<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>Among the famous queens of the world&mdash;Catharine
II of Russia, Elizabeth, Anne
Boleyn, and Victoria of England, Mary
Queen of Scots, Isabella of Spain, Louise
of Prussia, Marie Antoinette, Marie and Catharine
di Medici of France, and others, Maria Theresa of
Austria holds a conspicuous place. In statesmanship
and patriotism she ranks with Elizabeth and
Catharine. As Catharine greatly improved the
administration of her Empire, introduced new laws
and extended its frontiers, and as Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign
was characterized by great commercial enterprises and
extraordinary intellectual activity, so the reign of
Maria Theresa, though she was engaged for years in
two great wars,&mdash;that of the War of the Austrian
Succession and the Seven Years&rsquo; War with Frederick
for the recovery of Silesia, which he had taken from
her,&mdash;proved to be of the highest benefit to Austria
in the strengthening of law and the introduction of
needed reforms and wise measures for the welfare of
the Empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>For years she was engaged in war for the
preservation of Silesia with the most potent sovereign
in Europe&mdash;Frederick the Great. Doubtless he
had some antique claim upon Silesia, but when Maria
Theresa succeeded to the throne under the terms of
the Pragmatic Sanction, all the European powers,
Prussia among them, whose rights might be affected,
renounced their claims. She relied upon their good
faith, but on the slightest of pretexts Frederick broke
it and determined to rob her of Silesia, even at the
cost of plunging all Europe into a long and devastating
war. He set aside a new treaty to enforce an
old claim. He plainly condemned himself by his
own words in his Memoirs: &ldquo;Ambition, interest,
the desire of making people talk about me carried
the day and I decided for war.&rdquo; When peace was
finally made, Maria Theresa retained her old inheritance,
though she lost Silesia; but Frederick was
more than willing to make peace, for all Germany
had been a terrible sufferer by the war and Prussia
was in dire straits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</div>
<p>The story of the life of the
great queen is briefly told in these pages. It is the
story of the life of a proud, ambitious queen; a wise,
judicious ruler, who had the best interests of her
subjects at heart, and for whom they were always
ready to die; a woman of spotless personal character
and true to all her domestic duties at a time when
immorality and corruption were rife in high places.
The story covers some of the same episodes of
history which occur in the narrative of Frederick,
in this series, but is none the less interesting, as the
reader will find both sides presented.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">The Young Queen</span></h2>
<p>It would almost seem that the Emperor Charles
VI, the father of Maria Theresa, had a presentiment
of what was to come, when, directly
after his marriage, he obtained from the various
states united under his dominion an order of succession
called &ldquo;The Pragmatic Sanction,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> which
decreed that in case his house should become extinct
in the male line, succession to the throne
should pass to his female descendants. To make
this law binding and legal was such an important
matter to him that it may be said to have been the
chief aim of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>In the year 1716, to the great joy of the Emperor,
a son was born to him. Vienna and the whole
country shared in the rejoicings of the royal parents;
but unfortunately their happiness was of short
duration, for, before the Autumn of that year had
strewn the earth with withered leaves, the heir to
the throne had drooped and died. The Emperor&rsquo;s
grief was intense, and was made harder to bear by
reason of the many other cares and troubles which
beset him on all sides at that time.</p>
<p>The second child was a daughter, Maria Theresa,
who was born May 13, 1717,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> and upon whose
head, according to the right of primogeniture established
by the Pragmatic Sanction, the crowns of
the united Austrian states were one day to rest.
Who could have imagined that this child, while
inheriting all the beauty of her mother, would be
endowed at the same time with a masculinity of
intellect, together with a strength and wisdom, a
firmness yet kindliness of disposition, which but
few men have manifested?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>St. Ambrose&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hymn of Praise&rdquo; was at once
sung in the most solemn manner in St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Cathedral, in the presence of all the highest dignitaries
of the Empire, and the baptism of the heiress
to the throne took place on the evening of the day
of her birth with great pomp and splendor. After
the loss of their first-born, the imperial couple were
overjoyed at the advent of this child, and, amid all
the cares and responsibilities forced upon him by
his numerous wars, the devoted father never lost
sight of his fixed purpose or relaxed his efforts to
obtain universal recognition of his law of succession
among the European powers, as well as the various
states of his own empire. He felt the importance
of securing his beloved daughter&rsquo;s undisputed title
to the throne, while the Empress&rsquo; motherly heart
rejoiced at each hardly won acknowledgment of the
rights of her child, who already showed signs of
such splendid promise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>But it was not alone in such well-grounded and
well-directed efforts that the parents&rsquo; care showed itself:
no pains were spared to develop to the fullest
extent Maria Theresa&rsquo;s abundant mental gifts and
talents, so as to fit her for her future position as
ruler of an empire; nor did the noble mother fail to
sow the seed and nourish the growth in her daughter&rsquo;s
tender nature of those womanly virtues which
were to bear such rich harvest.</p>
<p>With loving eyes the wise and careful Empress
watched over the early training of the Princess&rsquo;
mind,&mdash;a mind which warranted the brightest
hopes of all those to whose hands her education
was intrusted. As may be readily understood,
these instructors were selected from among the
most distinguished ladies of the Court; the Countesses
von Thurn and Valsassina, von Stubenberg
and von Fuchs. They worked in perfect accord
with the august mother upon whose breast God
had placed the precious jewel, and to whose care
He had intrusted the treasure. Later, as it became
necessary for her to occupy herself with
more serious and important subjects, learned and
capable men were assigned the task of guiding
the clear and active mind of the Princess through
the departments of religion, history, and other
branches of learning, the comprehension of which
was deemed necessary. The study of languages,
too, was begun at an early age and covered a wide
range, as it was important that the future ruler of
Austria should be familiar with the various tongues
spoken within her dominions, and thus be able to
dispense with interpreters who might, and indeed
must inevitably, stand between her and her people
to a certain extent. Above all, it was requisite that
she should not only understand Latin but speak it
fluently, since that was the language spoken in
Hungary; and almost equally important was a
knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish. The
most accomplished masters were chosen by the imperial
parents, and equal care was bestowed on the
choice of teachers for music, drawing, and painting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>My young readers will perceive from this that
the Archduchess had no easy tasks to perform.</p>
<p>Though, as compared with the requirements of
our times, such an education may seem defective in
many respects, still it bore surprising fruit, due
largely to the remarkable endowments of her who
received it; she made such good use of it that it was
possible for her not only to assume the high position
that devolved upon her at an early age, but to
maintain it with strength and dignity through all
the troubled period of her minority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The following incident confirms the truth of this
statement. Maria Theresa was sixteen years of age
when the important and complicated question of the
election of a king of Poland was to be decided by
the King&rsquo;s councillors. The imperial maiden entered
the council chamber at her father&rsquo;s side, to
take part in the deliberations of the foremost statesmen
of the empire, and bore herself with a grace
and dignity that excited universal admiration. She
listened with grave attention to the wise words of
the councillors, but when it came her turn to
express her opinions, at her father&rsquo;s desire, the
astonishment of the ministers was unbounded, as
was the Emperor&rsquo;s delight also, at the clearness
and accuracy of her judgment, and the acuteness
and keenness of her perceptions.</p>
<p>This is given as a proof of her clear understanding
and early maturity of mind, but it must not be
supposed that these qualities detracted in any way
from her feminine charms. Indeed, her kindness
of heart, delicacy of thought, and above all her
moral purity and lofty strength of purpose, combined
to form a personality which seemed born to
rule by divine right over the hearts of men, as well as
to sway the sceptre of a mighty Empire; nor was her
power lessened by a physical beauty and grace that
made her the envy of all the princesses of Europe.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>Maria Theresa in the Council Chamber</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>As she approached the age when the question
who should one day share the throne with her had
to be seriously considered, its political bearing
began to assert itself; personal views were taken less
into account than careful calculations as to what
would benefit the crown and state and serve to increase
the national importance and influence. The
Emperor and his consort had already discussed the
question privately, before any of the foreign princes
had turned their glances toward the throne and the
heiress herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>An old tradition, to the effect that the crown of
Spain would one day be joined again to that which
was to adorn the beautiful head of Maria Theresa,
was much talked of in Vienna, and with even
more seriousness in Madrid. It came to nothing,
however, and this laid the foundations of a deep
and lasting enmity in Spain toward Austria. Other
alliances, too, were discussed and rejected. Whether
the affections of the Princess were involved in any
of them is doubtful, especially as there happened to
be a certain prince staying at the imperial court in
Vienna who lacked none of the attractions of mind
or person that particularly fitted him for success in
his wooing. This was Francis Stephen, son of
Duke Leopold and Hereditary Prince of Lorraine,
who was somewhat older indeed than the youthful
Archduchess, but worthy of her in every way. He
had succeeded to the dukedom of Lorraine on his
father&rsquo;s death, and there seemed no obstacles to
the alliance, either personal or political, when an
approaching war-cloud relegated all thoughts of
marriage into the background.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The centre of disturbance in those days was
Poland, a part it has repeatedly played since, under
other circumstances and conditions. The throne of
this unhappy land was vacant, and the number of
claimants, with the variety of their pretensions, made
it a veritable apple of discord. Charles VI supported
the claim of the Elector of Saxony, but
France, cherishing an old grudge, had other plans,
and took up arms against Austria. The war did
not last long, for Charles was anxious for peace; but
many important changes resulted, which reduced
Austria&rsquo;s possessions in Italy, and Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
betrothed, instead of remaining Duke of Lorraine,
was made Grand Duke of Tuscany. After peace
had been declared, preparations were resumed for the
marriage of the affianced pair. The nuptials were
celebrated with the greatest splendor; but unfortunately
the joy and satisfaction which the occasion
brought the Emperor were embittered by the disastrous
results of a war with Turkey, which made
the death of Prince Eugene,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> &ldquo;der edler Ritter,&rdquo;
even more keenly felt, since all that his sword had
won for Austria was lost again through the incompetency
of other commanders. Not long after
this, the happy young couple began their triumphal
journey to Tuscany, the sovereignty of which had
devolved upon the consort of the Archduchess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Emperor Charles&rsquo; most ardent desire, to see
a male heir born of this happy union, was not to be
fulfilled; he was forced to close his eyes full of
anxiety as to the continuation of his line and crushed
by the fatal peace of Belgrade, which had been such
a blow to him. His death occurred on October
20, 1740. The inheritance which he bequeathed
to Maria Theresa, as his heiress and successor, consisted
of little territory beyond what Prince Eugene&rsquo;s
sword had won and secured. Austria&rsquo;s possessions
had become greatly diminished by the results of
unfortunate wars. The great leaders and nobles of
the Empire, instead of working together to insure
the stability of the much-talked-of Pragmatic Sanction,
or, what was even more important, to fill the
treasury and establish and maintain an army that
should command respect, had ceased to be of any
help or support to the Emperor; while an exceedingly
lavish and brilliant Court swallowed up more
than the country&rsquo;s resources warranted. So when
Maria Theresa came to the throne, the state treasury
was almost empty, the army large only on paper; in
short, everything was lacking, and no order or system
existed anywhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The Emperor was a kind-hearted, cultivated, and
high-minded man, but not the kind of a ruler demanded
by the condition of affairs and the importance
of his position. He had a natural taste for art and
learning, and sympathized with all that was lofty and
noble. He was also devoted to the welfare of his
people and indefatigable in all that pertained to their
good; but in matters that concerned the political
position of Austria, he lacked the necessary firmness
and energy. Thus, while in some ways Maria
Theresa had only to maintain what her noble father
had planned and begun, in others she was obliged
to act on her own responsibility and strive to remedy
evils that needed a stronger and more masculine
hand than is often possessed by a woman. But to
her had been granted the clear, judicious mind and
resolute spirit of a born ruler; she was singularly
fitted for the difficult task, and what a man might
not have been able to accomplish even under the
most favorable circumstances, the woman and youthful
Empress effected with the happiest results. It
was no easy task for her, however, and the eyes
of Europe were fixed expectantly, if somewhat
doubtfully, on the fair young Princess who had
grasped the reins of government under such difficult
conditions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>One plan had been suggested to her which,
viewed in the light of subsequent events, must have
made a strong impression on her mind. When
the question of choosing a consort for the Emperor&rsquo;s
beautiful and promising daughter had been uppermost,
Prince Eugene of Savoy proposed a union
with the Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, he
who afterward deservedly won for himself the title
of &ldquo;the Great&rdquo;; and with his wonderful foresight
and sagacity&mdash;indeed, it would almost seem with a
prophetic vision of the future&mdash;strongly urged the
execution of his plan. He did not succeed in
uniting these two great hearts and minds, yet it
shows how free from prejudice the great hero was.
How different might the history of Europe have
been had this dream of the knightly hero been
realized! How far-reaching the consequences, extending
even to our own times! How much, alas!
that must be lamented, might Germany perhaps
have been spared! But it was otherwise decreed
in that high tribunal which rules all human affairs
and speaks the irrevocable words,&mdash;&ldquo;Thus Shall
It Be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Maria Theresa was not yet twenty-four years old
when she ascended the throne. She, whose insight
was so clear and judgment so unerring, could not
disguise from herself that her task was a hard one.
The gravity of it was ever present before her, but
she never allowed herself to be cast down or discouraged.
She was ill, too, when the Emperor
closed his eyes upon the troubles of this world, and
sorrow for her honored father, together with the
magnitude of her undertaking, lay heavily upon her
heart; but with a devout glance to heaven, a
fervent prayer for help to the source of all strength
and courage, her lofty spirit rose again with the
consciousness of divine aid and a firm resolve to
fulfil the duties that had been imposed upon her.
The leaders who should have been a support to her
were more overcome by the Emperor&rsquo;s death than
the devoted daughter who was able to conquer her
grief so heroically, and she was compelled to take
the lead, and revive their faltering spirits by her
powerful will and lofty courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>She had chosen for her motto one that she lived
up to in thought and deed from the first to the
last day of her reign, and of which all her acts and
ideas bore the impress, namely, <i>Justitia et Clementia</i>,
or, in English, &ldquo;Justice and Clemency.&rdquo; There
was very soon a brilliant illustration of the latter
quality. It was a time of want and distress for the
poor, and one of the first acts of her reign was to
throw open the well-filled imperial granaries and
induce the great lords in her dominions to do the
same. Is it any wonder that the people loved her
with an enthusiastic devotion, and revered her as
an angel sent to them from God? A second act,
which quickly followed, completed this impression
and strengthened its effect. Large herds of deer
had been allowed to overrun the country and become
a scourge to the industrious peasants, who
were compelled to look on quietly while the animals,
protected by law, grazed without hindrance over
their cultivated fields, or suffer the heaviest penalties
if they resisted. During the preceding year it had
been the cause of an uprising in Styria, and the
leaders of the rebellion had been condemned to
death. Here were two great wrongs to be redressed,
and the Empress did not hesitate to use the proper
means. She caused the deer to be shot and their
flesh publicly sold at the lowest prices, and pardoned
those under sentence of death in Styria, but
at the same time did not allow the insurgents
to escape without any punishment. Her motto,
&ldquo;Justice and Clemency,&rdquo; had become the rule of
her life, and it was thus she entered upon her
lofty and difficult sphere of action, with the God of
justice and clemency ever before her eyes and in
her heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>That many reforms were necessary was everywhere
made clear by the pressure of obsolete customs
and ideas; but that they could be effected
so promptly and thoroughly was more than any
one had dared to hope. How could it have been
expected that a woman, however wise, talented, and
full of lofty aims, should understand the condition
of the country well enough to decide at once upon
the changes that were necessary, and be able to lay
her hand upon the proper means for bringing them
about?</p>
<p>The surprising fact, however, was brought to
light that the young ruler was fully acquainted with
the state of affairs in her realm and with the causes
of the principal evils, which astonished the people
as much as it did her ministers, to whom she had
already revealed this unsuspected sagacity and penetration
at their first conference, thereby causing
some uneasiness to agitate the old gentlemen&rsquo;s
powdered wigs and make them anxious to assist
her in her reforms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Maria Theresa already had realized the force of
the advice Prince Eugene had so strongly urged
upon her father. The army was utterly demoralized;
the officers had unlimited leave of absence,
and frequently lived in Vienna or anywhere they
chose, except with their regiments and in their
quarters. So it was like a thunderbolt to them
when the young Empress issued orders for the
immediate return of all officers to their regiments,
and for the army to be increased and placed upon
such a footing that a sudden outbreak of war should
not find it unprepared; but at the same time she
won the devotion of the entire army by thus infusing
fresh life and vigor into the almost paralyzed
service, and also by another act of clemency. The
leading officers, colonels and generals, who had
been held responsible for the results of the last disastrous
Turkish war, and been made to pay heavily
for their mistakes by dismissal and imprisonment,
were not only liberated but restored to all their
former honors and dignities. The effect of this
upon the army was magical, and the shout of Hungary
in later days, &ldquo;We will die for our Empress!&rdquo;
swept through the army in an enthusiastic expression
of devotion and reverence, which was also
shared by the officers&rsquo; families.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Charles VI had been harshly blamed for the
enormous sums swallowed up by the imperial
household. The retinue of well-paid officials and
retainers was so numerous that they only hindered
the business at Court instead of promoting it, and
the salaries were out of all proportion to the services
rendered. Fraud and peculation, too, were
not wanting, and Maria Theresa found herself burdened
with a household which cost the state more
than the important affairs of government. With
her clear insight and resolute will, it was but a short
step from perception to action. She determined
that as far as was consistent with the dignity of the
Court, it should be regulated according to the system
that prevailed in lower ranks of life; the spirit of
display and show should be curbed, and a judicious
economy introduced. Dismissals accordingly took
place at once, salaries were decreased, many unnecessary
expenses done away with, and a strict inspection
of household accounts and expenditures
instituted; and, as Maria Theresa&rsquo;s consort also
brought his influence to bear in the control and
regulation of this as of other departments of state
finances, matters began to assume a very different
appearance, and the ever-pressing need for money
disappeared. The people, too, were delighted to see
that their beloved young ruler understood the management
of her vast household as well as any thrifty
German housewife. As in her administration of
the affairs of the Empire she showed a masculine
clearness and certainty in deciding between what
was proper or improper, right or wrong, so
here also her feminine instincts for order and
the practical management of domestic affairs were
conspicuous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>How much Maria Theresa loved and respected
her husband is shown very plainly in the fact that
she could not bear to have him occupy an inferior
position to her, and that she spared no pains to
make a way for him toward imperial honors.
Scarcely a month after their accession, she made
him co-regent and bestowed upon him the electoral
dignities which belonged to the crown of Bohemia,
thereby displaying not only her affection for him
but also her womanly tact and diplomacy. She
realized the strained relations with foreign courts
that existed in Austria, and well knew that only
the slightest provocation was needed to involve her
in terrible wars. Thus it was a question not only
of gratifying the dictates of her own heart, but also
of guarding against any errors or false steps which
her foes might seize upon and make an excuse for
active enmity; and she succeeded in this in a
masterly manner, though more depended upon the
observance of forms and ceremonies than their real
significance warranted. It was of the highest importance
not to give offence anywhere; for although
the so-called Pragmatic Sanction had been
recognized in many quarters,&mdash;a recognition too
often purchased by her father at a heavy sacrifice,&mdash;it
was by no means certain that objections
might not yet be raised against the step, as well as
against her elevation of her husband to imperial
honors, and that would mean war. It was therefore
a relief and satisfaction to her that the States of
her Empire did not delay in pronouncing their
hearty concurrence in both measures. When some
who opposed them showed their disapproval by
an absurd attempt to assert their authority, the
kindly sovereign maintained a discreet silence and
ignored it. Bavaria, indeed, asserted claims to
the crown of Bohemia; but when Maria Theresa,
in reply, sent troops to the disputed kingdom, a
wholesome fear weakened the ambition of Bavaria,
and the hint was sufficient to prevent any further
trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>So Maria Theresa&rsquo;s throne seemed firmly established
both at home and abroad. She had a loyal,
devoted people on one side and an enthusiastic
army on the other, to support her, and looked
cheerfully and hopefully into the future, where no
gathering storm, no lowering clouds, appeared to
threaten her peace and security.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Campaigns against Prussia, France, and Bohemia</span></h2>
<p>And yet&mdash;! Where the Spree winds along
between its sandy banks, a young eagle
was beginning his flight toward the sun.
Prince Eugene, &ldquo;the gallant knight,&rdquo;
had seen more clearly than he whose eyes were fixed
only on the Pragmatic Sanction. His good counsel
had shared the fate of all well-meant advice
which earns no thanks and is rarely followed, and
there was no one now at the imperial court who had
Eugene of Savoy&rsquo;s far-seeing vision in matters of
statecraft. But the eagle had already spread his pinions,
and though he had but one head, to be sure,
yet what a head it was! This eagle was the young
King of Prussia, Frederick, second of the name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The year 1740 had witnessed new rulers upon
two thrones: upon the smaller, and, one might say,
still embryonic one, a man; upon the greater,
already established, a woman; both young, energetic,
and richly endowed by nature, both the foremost
figures of their time.</p>
<p>The proverb, &ldquo;Two hard stones seldom grind
well,&rdquo; has much truth in it, and none the less if
the word &ldquo;hard&rdquo; be taken in a figurative sense.
Thousands of heads and hearts were agitated by
the question, how these two European monarchs of
equal birth and capabilities would get on together.
Would not all their power be exerted to obtain the
supremacy? And in this struggle, to use a popular
but expressive phrase, would not &ldquo;the fur fly&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It was only in Vienna that people were deceived
as to Frederick&rsquo;s strength. Those immediately
about the gifted young King were little concerned
as to the outcome of any warlike complications, for
from the very earliest days of his reign he had been
strengthening and equipping his army. A well-filled
treasury also favored his secretly cherished plan of
claiming the Duchy of Silesia, and winning back
with the sword what he considered his own inheritance,
according to some old agreement concerning
the succession.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> His army advanced suddenly
against Silesia, and he followed it immediately
after a court ball in Berlin, where no one had the
least suspicion of his intention. He despatched
Count Cotter to Vienna, it is true, to state the
terms by which war could be averted;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> but Austria
would not consent to them, and while these brief
negotiations were being conducted, Frederick&rsquo;s
army had already set foot upon the frontier of
Silesia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>This news fell upon the Austrian sovereign like
a thunderbolt out of a clear sky; but the die was
cast, the torch of war alight. To resign Silesia
voluntarily never entered her mind for a moment,
but alas! her father&rsquo;s indifference to Prince Eugene&rsquo;s
wise counsel was now bearing fruit. Although
not willing to accept Frederick&rsquo;s terms for a
peaceful settlement of the question, Maria Theresa
realized fully the difficulties of her situation, and
hastily called upon those who had recognized the
Pragmatic Sanction to redeem their promises and
lend her some substantial support now that so
powerful an assault had been made upon this measure.
But she only had to face the bitter experience
expressed in the old saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Friends in prosperity&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Each will weigh a pound;</p>
<p class="t0">But to the ounce, in time of need,</p>
<p class="t0">A thousand may be found!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Those whom she summoned to her aid shrugged
their shoulders, and sympathized, but made no
move to array themselves on her side. It is the
way of the world, and in this dark hour Maria
Theresa was forced to learn, in bitterness of spirit,
that there is a vast difference between words and
deeds.</p>
<p>There was not much time for choice. The situation
must be met at once; but the Austrian force
in Silesia was too small to build any hopes upon.
Browne<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> collected an army in Moravia; but to
cross the mountains by bad roads and at an unfavorable
time of year was a task not easily or
quickly accomplished, so that, thanks to his own
energy and his well-equipped and disciplined army,
Frederick made a rapid advance, and had gained
possession of the most important places before
Browne&rsquo;s troops could get near enough to attempt
any effective movements. When the cannon finally
thundered at Mollwitz, Schwerin<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> gained a brilliant
victory over the Austrians, little in his favor as the
conflict promised to be at first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The loss of this battle was a great disaster, and
the saying that troubles never come singly proved
true likewise. Thus encouraged, all the enemies of
Austria, who until now had prudently hidden their
real animosity under the mask of friendship, threw
off their disguise and openly arrayed themselves on
the side of the young King of Prussia. The aggrandizing
spirit of France, ever casting covetous
glances toward the Rhine, made itself most actively
felt, but intrigues were rife everywhere, and already
there was talk of a division of the Austrian Empire
among its enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Whether all these castles were to prove only
castles in the air depended now on Maria Theresa.
Old Austrian statesmen might doubtfully shake
their bewigged heads, but their youthful ruler
never wavered. Not a finger&rsquo;s breadth of Silesia
would she surrender; at no price would she voluntarily
part with any of her inheritance. She well
knew what her duty required, and the birth of a son
(afterward the great Emperor Joseph II) vindicated
this noble woman&rsquo;s firmness and masculine strength
of purpose. Her heart was full of faith and courage,
and the joy her maternity brought her was
shared by the people, who showed a touching devotion
to her. This was the foundation upon which
she built her hopes; and it was strong enough to
warrant confidence in Austria&rsquo;s future, though the
present looked dark enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>England made an effort to mediate between
Maria Theresa and her adversary, but Frederick
rejected any compromise and demanded the cession
of Silesia, with the threat that if it were not yielded
to him he would seize not only it, but four other
duchies beside. He could always be depended on
to keep his word, especially when he made emphatic
statements, and Maria Theresa&rsquo;s cause seemed lost
before it really was so. But she stood firm as a rock,
in spite of her increasing danger; in spite of the
faintheartedness of her ministers; in spite of the
plots of her enemies; in spite of Frederick II&rsquo;s
confidence. At any cost the war must be carried
on; she must not allow herself to be humbled.
The time for negotiation was past; action must
take its place; words were useless, deeds must
decide.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa&rsquo;s prospects were dubious. The
French had crossed the Rhine with a large force
and joined Bavaria. Passau was taken by surprise;
Linz had fallen; even Vienna was threatened, and
would have been obliged to surrender had the
enemy pressed its advantage that far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Maria Theresa had been active in her preparations
in the meantime. The love of the people for
their distressed ruler showed itself everywhere.
Men flocked to the recruiting stations, and all who
were able hastened to take up arms. In Vienna
there was the greatest enthusiasm; all work in
the shops ceased, and thousands of strong arms
toiled at the neglected fortifications of the imperial
city. Neither were there only men&rsquo;s hands at
work, for women and young girls were to be seen
in the ranks of the toilers, laboring indefatigably,
just as it had been when Kara Mustapha had approached
Vienna, and Kolonitzsch and the old hero
Stahremberg led the defence.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> Everywhere the
greatest interest was felt in the fate of the beautiful,
unfortunate Princess, and the women especially,
both of her own and foreign countries, showed the
warmest sympathy, while in England they vied with
one another in contributing money for her treasury,
knowing that she greatly needed such assistance.
But her foes were too many and too strong for her,
and all these efforts would have been in vain had
not Hungary, with chivalrous self-sacrifice, lent its
aid to the Princess who wore its sacred crown also.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa had won the love of the Hungarians,
and this conquest now bore her golden fruit,
for the love of a people is the only lasting bulwark
of a throne. Certain States, however, to assert their
own importance, seemed determined to break down
this bulwark. But when she appeared in the midst
of the assembly of the Hungarian States, her deeply
troubled look and the appeal that sprang from her
overladen heart fired the nobles with wild enthusiasm.
&ldquo;We are ready to die for our Queen, Maria
Theresa!&rdquo; rang from every throat and welled out
from every heart as an oath of fidelity, and the unanimous
resolution was at once taken to aid her with
all their forces.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p4.jpg" alt="" width="708" height="980" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>We are ready to die for our Empress</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Maria Theresa was deeply affected; she burst
into tears, and who does not know the effect that
tears in a woman&rsquo;s eyes have upon the hearts of
men? When Maria Theresa&rsquo;s consort had been
acknowledged as co-regent by the Hungarians, the
oath taken, and she held up her little son Joseph
before the Diet at that solemn moment, such a
burst of enthusiasm followed that they swore afresh
their willingness to die for their Queen, and declared
firmly that if money were needed for the war they
would cast all their gold and silver ornaments and
vessels into the smelting-pot,&mdash;indeed, were this
not enough, even the treasures of the Church
should be added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>If anything could have comforted Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
mind and raised her spirits, it would have
been this experience. There is not much danger
of a tottering throne where the people are so ready
to prove their devotion by any sacrifice; and what
Hungary promised it faithfully performed. At
this time the mixture of peoples along the Danube,
where it approaches the Turkish possessions, with
the tribes that Russia in Asia had contributed,
could hardly have been equalled for wildness and
barbarity. They were good light horsemen, and
always ready when it was a question of destruction
and pillage; but in open warfare against the well-drilled
Prussians they stood but a doubtful chance.
Nevertheless, they had Cossacks among them that
had not done badly in harassing the French. The
Hungarians, though headed by a nobility of their
own, had only these people to depend on, but they
were better than nothing, and the fifteen thousand
nobles with their followers made a heavy balance
in the scales. Every heart was full of enthusiasm
for the noble woman who was so hard pressed,
and while their forces were being organized&mdash;for an
army is not raised by the stroke of a magic wand&mdash;this
sentiment deepened continually.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>While the hostile army had already advanced as
far as Linz, the Queen hoped for assistance from
England in the shape of gold from London and
troops from Hanover, but it seemed in truth as
though all help would be cut off. Even when
George II of England had raised an army in
Hanover, the French, under Maillebois, marched
up through Westphalia, and the English began to
find Hanover uncomfortable. With an Englishman
charity begins at home, and George&rsquo;s &ldquo;skin was
nearer to him than his shirt,&rdquo; as the saying goes, so
he made the best terms he could with the French,
and abandoned Maria Theresa in spite of all his
chivalrous protestations.</p>
<p>With France, Bavaria, and Saxony threatening
her on one side, Prussia on the other, and as yet
no army to oppose them with any hope of success,
what could be more welcome than a settlement with
Frederick II, arranged by England&rsquo;s mediation, and
to which Frederick gladly agreed, since it secured
him the possession of Silesia and averted the danger
that seemed impending from the attitude of the
Elector of Bavaria? The treaty was signed at
Oberschnellendorf, but absolute secrecy was to be
maintained concerning it. Thus Maria Theresa
acquired, in this direction, at least, a free hand;
and it was very necessary, for Bavaria and France
were seriously threatening the capital of Bohemia,
whence the Elector of Bavaria might have taken
Vienna at a single blow, but, allured by the prospect
of a crown, the attraction in Bohemia was too
strong.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Such was the state of affairs when Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
army of sixty thousand men entered Bohemia and
rapidly advanced toward Prague, hoping to be able
to relieve the city, which had a garrison of only
three thousand and was in no condition to hold
out against an army like that of united France,
Bavaria, and Saxony, which was pressing it hard.
There could be no question of a long resistance;
therefore haste was necessary for the Austrians if
they were to be of any service. But they came too
late. Prague had fallen, and the Elector of Bavaria
was crowned King of Bohemia. This, however, to
him, was but a step toward the Imperial Crown,
which he already saw upon his head. Therefore, no
sooner were the coronation ceremonies ended than
he established a regency in Prague, hastened to
Munich, and from thence by way of Mannheim to
Frankfort-on-the-Main. One thought, one hope,
sustained Maria Theresa after this bitter blow,&mdash;namely,
that her husband would be chosen Emperor
at the electoral assembly then being held at
Frankfort; but here, too, a fresh disappointment
awaited her. The Elector of Bavaria&rsquo;s successes in
Bohemia added powerfully to his influence, and he
was elected Emperor January 30, 1742, his coronation
following, February 12 of the same year. That
Maria Theresa should refuse to acknowledge him
was but natural, and, as she denied the validity of
the election, that she should refuse to deliver the
imperial archives was also natural.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The Elector of Bavaria at last had reached the
summit of his ambitions, but it was also the turning
point; thenceforward his path led downward,
and victory turned toward Maria Theresa&rsquo;s colors.
Scarcely was the crown placed on his head, when his
own capital, Munich, fell into the hands of Maria
Theresa. Her husband had succeeded in Bohemia,
with the gallant Khevenh&uuml;ller&rsquo;s assistance, in winning
the Hungarians to him and cutting off the enemy&rsquo;s
forces there from those which remained in Austria,
and thus began a campaign that meant destruction to
the audacious foe. In Bavaria the Austrians carried
all before them, and Maria Theresa&rsquo;s victorious
banner was soon waving over all that province.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>This state of things naturally attracted the attention
of Frederick II, and drew him again into the
field of action. As the agreement to keep the treaty
of Oberschnellendorf had been broken, he no longer
felt bound by his own promise. He again joined
forces with the hard-pressed Elector, the new Emperor,
and a fresh war-torch was set ablaze, which
alarmed Maria Theresa more than the old one.
Frederick&rsquo;s arms were victorious, his activity in
making alliances against Austria unceasing, and when
the Zieten<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> hussars made inroads as far as Stockerau,
destruction seemed hanging once more over Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s head. The storm did not break, however,
for Frederick found himself checked by Saxony, and
the French were little inclined to play into the hands
of Prussia. Frederick would gladly have consented
to an adjustment of his relations with Austria, had
it been possible; but the battles of Chotusitz and
Czaslau changed the aspect of things, for they gave
him the victory, though at a terrible sacrifice. Nevertheless,
his view of the situation was not altered to
such an extent that he did not still wish to end the
war. With the same desire on both sides there
could be but one result, and peace was signed at
Breslau in the Summer of 1742.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>By this treaty Frederick received the duchy of
Upper and Lower Silesia and Glatz, and renounced
all further claims on Maria Theresa. The boundaries
were firmly fixed, and she won a free hand in
this quarter, but with a loss that cut her to the
heart. The finest jewel had been torn from her
crown, and with a bleeding heart she had been forced
to give it up in order to save the rest of her inheritance.
On one side the flames of war were now extinguished,
but on the other they still blazed fiercely.
Her hopes were nearing fulfilment. The troops
which she had been obliged to employ against Frederick
could now be sent to oppose her other foes, and
this was a great gain, for this division of her strength
had been a constant source of anxiety to her, and
with good reason. Bohemia next claimed her attention,
and thither she sent the forces thus released.
Nor was this the only reward so dearly bought by
the peace of Breslau; for her friends were now
encouraged to show their sympathy and offer her
assistance. To win back Bohemia and its capital
was her next important task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>In Italy the situation had improved for her&mdash;not
without some sacrifice, it is true&mdash;and from there
she could also send troops to Bohemia, to enable the
Austrian army to invest Prague. In the besieged
city were a body of French, and this caused as
much anxiety in Paris as it did to Marshal Belle-Isle
himself in Prague. He tried to make terms,
but his schemes were frustrated, as well as the proposed
negotiations for peace from Paris, by the
resolute courage and firmness of the Empress. She
would listen to none of Francis&rsquo; proposals, none of
Belle-Isle&rsquo;s plans for capitulation. She rejected
both with noble pride and indignation, deeply as
her refusal might be resented by France.</p>
<p>In Prague the distress of the French increased
rapidly. The lack of provisions had become alarming.
Belle-Isle had only one hope&mdash;the French
auxiliary corps under Harcourt which Khevenh&uuml;ller
was holding back on the Danube. But could
he count on it? The army on the lower Rhine
was in the same predicament. Here, as there, a
decided &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; had been called to France, which
she was compelled to obey. It seemed impossible
that their comrades in Prague could expect any
help from either of these quarters; yet nevertheless
it came, at the express command of the King
of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The commander-in-chief of the French on the
lower Rhine, where an English force was opposing
them, suddenly departed, leaving one division engaged
with the English, and hastened unobstructed
to Bavaria, where he was joined by a Bavarian army
corps. At the same time Count Maurice of Saxony
replaced Harcourt in the army on the Danube. He
also contrived to elude Khevenh&uuml;ller, and made all
speed with the main body of his troops toward
Maillebois&rsquo; division. The bold stroke was successful,
and while the besieging army, apprised of this
new danger, was hastening to meet it, the beleaguered
French tried to escape from Prague and join Maillebois.
The attempt failed, however, as did that
general&rsquo;s efforts to relieve the city. Closely invested
as it now was by Lobkowitz, Prague could no longer
hold out; for, in addition to the scarcity of food, they
had to endure the bitter cold of Winter, and there
was a lack of fuel also. He conducted the siege so
carelessly, however, that Belle-Isle finally managed
to escape with the French garrison and all the artillery
and stores. Not till they were gone did the
Austrians discover it and pursue them; but they
succeeded in reaching Eger, though with great suffering
and loss. Those who were left behind in Prague
would have been taken prisoners had not their leader
made known to the Austrian commander that they
must be allowed to retire with military honors, or
he would set fire to the city and bury himself and
all his troops under its ashes. Lobkowitz consented
to their retreat in order to save Prague, and thus
ingloriously took possession of the shattered city.
Had Maria Theresa not had a kind and merciful
heart, the inhabitants would have suffered even more
than they had been called upon to endure; for many
of those who had been so ready to help crown the
Elector of Bavaria well deserved the punishment
they thus escaped. Now that Bohemia as far as
the city of Eger was once more her own, Maria
Theresa was crowned with great pomp as Queen of
Bohemia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>An anecdote in this connection will be of interest.
A courier arrived from Charles VII, bringing a
protest from him, as crowned King of Bohemia,
against Maria Theresa&rsquo;s coronation. Smiling, she
ordered the courier to be given a number of her gold
coronation coins, with instructions to carry them
back to his master without delay. This was done,
and doubtless the sight of the coins caused little
pleasure in Munich.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Fortune now seemed to favor Maria Theresa
everywhere. In Italy, too, events had shaped themselves
to her advantage, and at the close of the year
1742 she could look cheerfully into the future,
although the sky was not entirely cloudless; for in
Italy there were many knots to be untied that only
the sword could loosen.</p>
<p>The Spring saw banners waving and heard the roll
of the drums in Bavaria. The Bavarian Field Marshal
von Seckendorff, who had been ordered back to
Munich by his lord and emperor, fell back across
the Iser before Prince Charles of Lorraine and old
Khevenh&uuml;ller, who were pressing him hotly. The
French general, Broglio, meanwhile inactive in
Osterhof, watching these proceedings, made no response
to Seckendorff&rsquo;s appeals. Nor was this
retreat all; for, more important still, the whole
division under General Minuzzi was completely
crushed by the Austrians in a bloody battle, where
Minuzzi himself was taken prisoner. This was a
Spring greeting most joyfully received in Vienna,
and which seemed but a forerunner of still further
victories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>No sooner was this accomplished than Khevenh&uuml;ller
turned his attention to the French, whom he
would gladly have shown the way across the Rhine.
Broglio may have suspected this, and was so obliging
as to relieve the old hero of this agreeable task,
for at Khevenh&uuml;ller&rsquo;s approach he turned his troops
toward Ingolstadt (which was not forward) and kept
his movements secret until he was across the Rhine,
where twelve thousand men would re&euml;nforce him.
Then, and then only, did he feel himself safe.
Bavaria now realized what she was to expect from
her light-footed allies, and sent them no thanks.
Charles VII, too, knew at last upon what he had been
relying and that he must once more bid farewell to
his good city of Munich, if, indeed, he might not be
obliged to occupy an unsought lodging in Vienna.
Had he looked at this time at the coronation coins
brought him by the courier from Vienna, it must have
seemed that a mocking smile hovered about Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s lips, and that she whispered softly but significantly,
&ldquo;<i>Auf wiedersehen!</i>&rdquo; There was no choice
left him but to enter into negotiations with Austria
to protect his ancestral domains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Maria Theresa, in the midst of her victorious
career, offered the hand of peace. Charles VII
renounced his claims to the Austrian succession and,
fortunately for the public tranquillity, left all the conquered
territory in the possession of Austria. To
guard against any future trouble Maria Theresa had
all these States take the oath of allegiance to her,
even though they might be only temporarily in her
possession. This was a triumph for her which offset
the homage received by Charles in Bohemia,&mdash;a
return which he had well deserved and which he
well understood without any further explanation.</p>
<p>Thus fortune still smiled upon Maria Theresa,
here as elsewhere. The English army in the
Netherlands had crossed the Rhine, and, advancing
by way of Frankfort, received a large re&euml;nforcement
and tried to effect a union with Khevenh&uuml;ller
and Prince Charles of Lorraine, who had pushed
forward from the Upper Rhine. Marshal de
Noailles was opposing them with a considerable
force, but when he perceived their design he
crossed the Rhine to attack the English. George
II himself joined the army just then, fortunately,
and a battle was fought at Dettingen, on the Main,
which resulted in Noailles&rsquo; retreat across the Rhine
again. The King of England then held a council
of war with Khevenh&uuml;ller and the Prince at
Hainault to decide what course to pursue. It was
agreed that King George should lead the way
while the Austrian generals crossed the river at
Basel and try to reach Lorraine, in order to take
up Winter quarters in Champagne. This plan miscarried,
however, and the Austrian army returned
to Bavaria for the Winter, while King George, after
destroying the French works on the Rhine, especially
at Landau, withdrew again across the river and
also went into Winter quarters, for Winter campaigns
were not generally undertaken at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Though the results of the wars Maria Theresa
was waging against her enemies were most gratifying,
the troubles in Italy still weighed like an Alp
upon her heart. The Spanish general in command
there had drawn upon himself, and not without
cause, the reproach of negligence. A substitute
had replaced him with urgent orders to retrieve the
errors of his predecessor, and he might have been
able to do so had he not had an adversary so
brave, crafty, and well versed in the arts of war as
the old field-marshal, Count Traun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Already there had been a bloody battle, February
8, 1743, in which he had been the victor, but at
this time negotiations were begun which put an end
to the bloodshed. They took place at Worms,
between England, Sardinia, and Austria, and again
was Maria Theresa obliged to resign some of her
territory, this time in Sardinia, in order to effect
the alliance. Scarcely were the terms completed,
when Lobkowitz, who had succeeded old Traun in
the command, advanced against the Spaniards and
drove them back: whereupon the King of Sardinia
struck the French-Spanish army such a blow that
it was forced to retreat to the south of France for
the Winter.</p>
<p>Though Maria Theresa had been unfortunate in
having to relinquish more of her territory in this
campaign, still, the armies were victorious, and all
these circumstances had served to unite her more
closely to her friends, and had given her a new ally
in the person of the Elector Frederick Augustus IV
of Saxony, with twenty thousand troops to assist
her. Thus far the outlook was very bright; but
by the close of the year 1743 new clouds foretold a
gathering storm. The lion on the Spree had begun
to stir and toss his mane. Frederick&rsquo;s army, which
had once in jest been called the &ldquo;Potsdam Night-watch
Parade,&rdquo; was as little a subject for derision as
he who commanded and was the soul of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Second Silesian War</span></h2>
<p>Although she had prepared for it
carefully, Maria Theresa could not look
forward with much confidence to this
new struggle, which began in the Spring.
Khevenh&uuml;ller was dead, and she had shed tears of
sorrow and gratitude for him, which the brave old
soldier had well deserved from his sovereign. She
felt the loss of his strong support in this war, upon
which France, who heretofore had merely been an
ally of the enemies of Austria, had now entered on
her own account, in league with Spain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The campaign began in the Netherlands, where a
well-organized French army under capable leadership
was arrayed against the combined forces of Austria,
Holland, and England, the latter being under various
commands and far inferior in numbers. The advantage,
therefore, was decidedly with the French. To
offset this, an Austrian force was sent to invade
Alsace, which was occupied by French and Bavarian
troops. It was led by Prince Charles of Lorraine
and brave old &ldquo;Father Traun,&rdquo; as the soldiers called
the old Count, who was universally beloved by them.
In the Netherlands fortune favored the French; in
Alsace, the Austrians. Prince Charles of Lorraine
marched triumphantly into Lorraine, and his light
cavalry made inroads as far as the environs of
L&uuml;neville, where he was checked by fresh forces
under able generals sent from France to oppose his
victorious advance.</p>
<p>Such was the state of affairs beyond the Rhine
when the second Silesian war involved Maria
Theresa in fresh troubles. Frederick II, who was
anxious about the safety of his newly acquired possessions,
had taken advantage of the peace further
to strengthen his army and make all his preparations
for a campaign. Moreover, he understood
how to fill the public treasury without seeming to
impair the resources or prosperity of the people&mdash;certainly
a great and rare art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>At this important juncture, when Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
attention was fully occupied in the Netherlands and
in Alsace, he had a well-equipped army of one
hundred and twenty thousand men, an abundance
of stores and ammunition, and, above all, plenty of
money at his command, which Montecuculi<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> rightly
called the first, second, and third requirements for
conducting a war, and of which Austria had never
possessed a surplus, least of all now. Frederick&rsquo;s
apprehensions concerning Silesia were strengthened
by the fact that, since the peace of Breslau, Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s power had increased to such an extent
that with the assistance of her allies she might easily
plan to reconquer the province whose loss she had
never forgotten; indeed, he felt sure this would be
the case. He followed one of his own precepts
when he took up the sword again, &ldquo;that it is
always the greatest folly not to anticipate a disaster,
if one hopes to avert it.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he
clearly realized the advantages of an alliance with
the neutral German princes, and tried hard to bring
it about; and when this plan failed, he joined forces
with France, the Emperor Charles VII, and others,
thus insuring the success of his plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Maria Theresa&rsquo;s heart sank when she heard of
this, but trust in God and the justice of her cause
sustained her, as these words of hers prove: &ldquo;God
knows my right; He will protect me as He has
hitherto done!&rdquo; Many letters were exchanged
between Frederick and herself, each charging the
other with breaking their treaty; but it was of no
avail. War was finally declared, ostensibly in behalf
of the Emperor Charles VII, and Frederick&rsquo;s army,
one hundred thousand strong, invaded Bohemia,
while a part of it was sent to guard Kurmark<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and
Silesia. Saxony was stunned when Frederick without
further ceremony crossed its frontiers, and
made some fruitless attempts at resistance, but Zieten
cleared the way with his huzzars, and in an incredibly
short time Frederick was before Prague.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Maria Theresa called out the militia of the country
to meet the danger; but of what avail was the
militia against the invincible Prussians? Where
should she turn for aid in her extremity but to her
loyal Hungary? She hastened to Presburg, where
once more her words and her beauty kindled a
blaze of enthusiasm and devotion, and almost as if
sprung from the earth forty thousand Hungarians
stood ready to fight for her; thirty thousand more
formed the reserve, and ten thousand were hurriedly
despatched to Bohemia to oppose Frederick. This
was the work of the old Palatine Palffy, who was
no longer able to do any fighting himself. Maria
Theresa wrote him that charming letter which will
ever remain a model in the art of saying much in
few words, and with it sent her finest horse, a costly
jewelled sword, and a valuable diamond ring. She
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My Father Palffy</span>,&mdash;I send you this horse, which
is worthy of being mounted only by the noblest of my subjects;
accept also this sword to defend me against my enemies,
and keep this ring as a token of my lasting affection.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Theresa.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sending of the letter and the gifts was soon
known all over Hungary, and its effect upon a
people so easily roused to enthusiasm, and at the
same time ready to devote themselves to her cause
with the last drop of their blood, may well be imagined.
Before help could arrive, however, Frederick
had taken Prague, and several other important
cities also fell into his hands. The friends of
Maria Theresa began to lose courage, but not she!
When the Hungarians arrived, she forced Saxony
into some decisive course and recalled Prince
Charles of Lorraine to Bohemia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of such an undertaking
against so powerful an adversary, Prince
Charles met with brilliant success, and the troops
from Alsace were aided by auxiliary forces from
Saxony. Old Count Traun found the plan of cutting
Frederick off from Prague and conquering him
by starvation an excellent one, and proceeded to
carry it out in a masterly manner. Frederick
sought to force his adversary into a battle, but the
latter continually evaded him. Traun&rsquo;s light horsemen
harassed his troops on every side and captured
his provision train, while the Bohemians, with their
Queen&rsquo;s soldiers, buried the stores in the ground
and then made their escape in the forests. Frederick
was beside himself with rage. His soldiers,
suffering from hunger and every discomfort, quarrelled
among themselves and deserted in large numbers,
and at last, though much against his will, he
was obliged to begin a retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Thus the Austrians again came into possession of
Bohemia, with but trifling losses; and old &ldquo;Father
Traun,&rdquo; thinking it wise to follow the Prussians,
even entered Glatz and Upper Silesia. Already it
began to seem as though Maria Theresa might regain
her beloved Silesia, when all at once the tables
were turned.</p>
<p>The army imprudently had been allowed to scatter.
The troops from Saxony had withdrawn and
other divisions had been despatched elsewhere,
when the Prussians suddenly turned and assumed
the offensive, and Traun was obliged to retreat to
Moravia. The Austrians struck a few more vigorous
blows, and the campaign ended in both armies
going into Winter quarters. Although she had been
obliged to yield some advantages to Frederick, the
campaign on the whole had resulted decidedly in
Maria Theresa&rsquo;s favor. Frederick was disposed
therefore to make peace, and signified his willingness
to do so, but Maria Theresa rejected his overtures,
since she had formed a new alliance with England,
Holland, and Saxony, and now had a prospect of
retrieving her losses and winning back Silesia, the
lost jewel that had been torn from her crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>With this bright outlook for the future, the
Spring campaign was just beginning, when the Emperor
Charles VII died, January 20, 1745. This
event completely changed the aspect of affairs, and
the imperial crown, once possessed by her own
house, seemed to Maria Theresa a prize worth any
effort could she but see it placed upon the head of
her consort.</p>
<p>Little heed was paid to the unfortunate Emperor&rsquo;s
advice to his son, Maximilian Joseph, to make peace
with Austria and banish all hopes of the imperial
crown from his heart. The young Elector was only
too ready to listen to ambitious schemers, but before
the earth was fully decked with living green, all his
hopes had perished. The victories of the Austrians
compelled him, as they once had done his father, to
fly from Munich. Then for the first time he realized
the wisdom of his father&rsquo;s counsel, and refused to
listen any longer to those who advised him to continue
the struggle. He sued for peace, which was
concluded on April 22, 1745, at F&uuml;ssen. Austria
restored all his conquered territory to him, while he
renounced his claims to the succession, acknowledged
Maria Theresa&rsquo;s rights under the Pragmatic
Sanction, and promised her husband his vote at
the imperial election. The Empress&rsquo; heart beat
high with joy, for this broke the alliance known as
the &ldquo;Frankfort Union,&rdquo; and Frederick II now
stood alone. His situation became even more
threatening when Russia announced that she would
permit no attack on Saxony, which amounted to an
unequivocal if tacit declaration that in such a case
she would join the league that had been formed in
Warsaw between Austria, England, Holland, and
Saxony, called the &ldquo;Quadruple Alliance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Frederick now concluded it was better to seek
peace than to enter the lists against such odds; but
all his attempts at negotiation were frustrated, notwithstanding
the advantageous character of the conditions
he offered. Maria Theresa was determined
to have Silesia back again, but he would not agree
to that. She then tried to win over Saxony, and in
that she succeeded brilliantly. The prospect looked
dark for Frederick II, for he also was in need of
money. The royal plate had already found its way
secretly to the mint, to reappear in silver coins,
but that was insufficient. The King did not attempt
to conceal the fact from himself that he
stood on the edge of a precipice, but a spirit like
his was not to be daunted by fear of threatening
spectres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The campaign finally reopened under these altered
conditions. Maria Theresa sent eighty thousand
of her troops, with thirty thousand Saxons, to
take possession of Silesia. This army was in high
spirits, for it was rumored all over the country that
Frederick was completely discouraged and disheartened
by the misfortunes of the last campaign. No
one suspected that he himself had caused this report
to be circulated. He wanted to entice the Austrians
across the mountains, and they walked into
the trap. Frederick had taken up a position that
would enable him to fall upon the enemy as it
emerged from the mountains, and he awaited Prince
Charles with perfect calmness and confidence. His
concealed position completely deceived the Austrians;
they supposed the small band of Prussians,
which they had discovered from a mountain top, to
be part of the rear-guard of the army retreating to
Breslau.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>When Frederick crossed the stream at Striegau
on the morning of the fourth of June, his troops encountered
two battalions of Saxons, who were not a
little startled to meet with Prussians there. They
halted to wait for the rest of the army to come up
with them, but it had scarcely made its appearance
when Frederick opened a murderous artillery fire.
The Austrian cavalry hurled itself upon the Prussians,
but was soon thrown into wildest confusion
and totally routed. The two Saxon battalions
that had led the way were almost entirely cut to
pieces, and the Austrians who followed shared the
same fate. The Prince of Lorraine was thoroughly
deceived, for he supposed the cannonading and fire
of musketry came from the Saxons who were capturing
Striegau. It did not occur to him, therefore, to
send relief, for he still imagined the Prussians in
full retreat toward Breslau. When at last he discovered
the Saxons in disorderly flight and realized
what had happened, he hastened to place his troops
in order of battle, but before this could be accomplished
the Prussians had attacked and routed
them. Nothing was left for him, after five hours&rsquo;
hard fighting, but to turn about and escape by way
of Hohenfriedberg. They were not pursued, for
Frederick&rsquo;s army was too exhausted after the struggle.
It was a terribly disastrous battle for Austria
and Saxony, and for Frederick a victory which did
not produce the results it seemed to promise.</p>
<p>Prince Charles withdrew to Bohemia, and took
up a strong position there with the Saxons. Frederick
followed, but did not dare to attack him while
he was so strongly intrenched, and remained there
inactive for three months, while the Austrians had
as little desire to assume the offensive before the
arrival of re&euml;nforcements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>All this time the war in Flanders had been
blazing fiercely, and the French had gained several
victories over the allies. The King of England,
George II, who had been placed in a very trying
position by France, was anxious for Maria Theresa
and Frederick to make terms with each other, and
tried his best to bring it about. An agreement was
actually drawn up, but when Maria Theresa found
that the King of England had guaranteed the possession
of Silesia to Frederick, she firmly refused to
have anything more to do with it. Rather would
she&mdash;and these were her own words&mdash;&ldquo;part with
the gown from her back than Silesia.&rdquo; She attached
but little importance to the lost battle of Hohenfriedberg,
and had perfect confidence in the judgment
and bravery of Prince Charles of Lorraine
and the loyalty of her Hungarians. Moreover, the
prospects were good that the imperial crown would
fall to her husband&rsquo;s lot. How then could she
resign herself to the thought of sacrificing her
beloved Silesia?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Her consort, Francis Stephen, was indeed elected
Emperor and crowned under the name of Francis I,
and thus Maria Theresa&rsquo;s dearest wish was fulfilled.
She had fresh hope and courage, and a vigorous
prosecution of the war was ordered.</p>
<p>The plans of George II of England came to
naught, and Frederick resumed hostilities, for the
Empress would never consent to give up Silesia;
but he knew his task was a hard one. In Silesia
the Hungarians had taken Kosel. A part of his
army was sent to recapture it and drive them out,
in which it was successful. Another detachment
went to join old Dessauer at Halle, to oppose the
Saxons who were threatening Brandenburg. Frederick
had but twenty-two thousand men to oppose
a superior force of Austrians, and delay had placed
them at a disadvantage; for it had enabled the
enemy to approach so near that an attack could not
be avoided. He determined therefore to change his
position and move farther away; but just as he was
about to put this plan into execution, Charles of
Lorraine began his assault. It was on the morning
of September 30, 1745, near Sohr. Frederick still
had time to dispose his troops; then he hurled his
cavalry against the Austrians. This was the beginning
of a battle that resulted in a brilliant victory
for the Prussians, for the infantry with magnificent
bravery followed the example of the cavalry. For
five days Frederick&rsquo;s army camped undisturbed on
the battlefield, and then moved toward Silesia to go
into Winter quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Once more there were hopes of peace, but it was
not yet to be. In Vienna a Winter campaign had
been determined on. The army was to advance
directly to Berlin under the Prince of Lorraine.
One division on the Rhine was to unite with Saxony
in driving the Prussians from Halle, and then join
the main army before Berlin. Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
secret plans were betrayed, however, to the King of
Prussia, and that enabled him to set every lever in
motion to thwart her projects, in accordance with his
favorite method, &ldquo;anticipate the disaster.&rdquo; It was
dangerous work for him, for Russia had promised to
support Saxony in case of attack from Prussia, and
the warning was repeated when Frederick announced
his purpose; but strong measures were necessary,
and he departed to join the main body of his army
in Silesia. Here he learned that Prince Charles
and the Saxons had invaded Upper Lusatia. After
seeing that the Silesian frontier was well protected,
therefore, he hastened with all possible secrecy to
Lusatia and met the enemy at Kunersdorf. His
sudden attack was successful, and put an end to all
hopes of taking Berlin by surprise. The unexpected
appearance of the Prussians and their victory
disheartened the Austrian army, and Prince Charles
retreated to Bohemia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Nor was this defeat all. Frederick summoned
old Dessauer to Saxony, advanced against Dresden,
and made an offer of peace to Saxony, but it was
rejected. The sword had to settle the question,
which it speedily did. The battle of Kesselsdorf
was decisive; a bad blunder of the Saxons gave the
victory to Prussia, and obliged Prince Charles to
seek safety with his army. The defeated Saxons
abandoned their capital, and Frederick entered
Dresden, December 18, 1745. This opened the
way for peace, and terms were made soon afterward
by which Frederick definitely acknowledged Maria
Theresa&rsquo;s right to the electoral vote of Bohemia
and the validity of her husband&rsquo;s election as
Emperor, but retained possession of Silesia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Thus Austria, great as her losses had been in
this war, had at least gained what the Empress so
earnestly desired; but at the same time had been
again obliged to leave Silesia in the hands of Prussia
and put a good face on the matter. Saxony, on the
other hand, had felt the full weight of the conqueror&rsquo;s
hand, and was glad to come out of it so
cheaply after all. The treaty of Dresden also securely
settled various other affairs of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
at home, which had been disturbed by the
long and ruinous conflict.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Plots and Counterplots</span></h2>
<p>In Italy, affairs proved even more disastrous.
Genoa, which up to this time had remained
neutral, now sided with Spain, Naples, and
France, so that there was an addition of ten thousand
men to the enemy&rsquo;s forces to be reckoned with
when the campaign opened in May. This gave
them an army of seventy thousand capable of crushing
Austria and its ally Sardinia.</p>
<p>The outlook was dark for Maria Theresa when
the Dresden Treaty was signed. While on the one
hand it brought respite, on the other redoubled vigilance
and energy were needed. The overburdened
Empress breathed a little more freely, and calmly
faced the situation in Italy, where she had sent re&euml;nforcements
to the army and placed Prince Wenzel
Lichtenstein in command. Thirty thousand fresh
troops, with a <i>man</i> at their head, count for a great
deal; the latter even more than the former, since any
number of troops without a competent leader can
accomplish little.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The new campaign, in the Spring of 1746, began
hopefully, and its promise was realized largely by
an unforeseen event which occurred on the ninth of
July and made an important change in the situation.
This was the death of King Philip V of Spain,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> and
the succession to the throne of Ferdinand VI,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> who
was anxious for peace.</p>
<p>A change in the leadership of the Spanish forces
in Italy had already weakened them, and the recall
of six thousand men to Spain greatly increased Lichtenstein&rsquo;s
advantage, as results were not slow in proving.
The battle of the tenth of August disposed of
the Spaniards as far as Maria Theresa&rsquo;s army was concerned,
and left it free to chastise Genoa. That Republic,
already alarmed at the turn of events, became
panicstricken when the Austrians captured Bocchetta,
and the Senate bowed its once proud neck
beneath the foot of the victor. The punishment it
had so well merited was not lacking when the day of
reckoning came. Maria Theresa magnanimously,
indeed, sought to save Genoa from the depths of humiliation
to which Botta relentlessly subjected it, for
the crippled Republic had suffered enough,&mdash;and
too much, as the sequel showed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>At this juncture, when the army was victorious
and both ready and able to continue the work,
Maria Theresa&rsquo;s plans were frustrated by the jealousy
of England and Sardinia. The two allies felt
obliged to turn their arms against Naples, which lay
so near, and the result was obvious: the Empress
was forced to abandon them and follow the French
and Spaniards to Nice. The advance into Provence,
however, was suddenly brought to a standstill,
because of the harsh treatment Genoa had received.
The bow had been bent too far, and it broke. A
popular insurrection was the fruit of Botta&rsquo;s revenge.
Austria&rsquo;s disregard of the fact that a people driven
to desperation will risk everything&mdash;a fact unfortunately
too often forgotten, in spite of the terrible
examples in history,&mdash;cost it dearly; for, aside from
its material losses in men and supplies, Botta&rsquo;s flight
and the forced retreat of Browne from Provence
were bitter fruit. Nor was it made any less so by
the loss of Genoa itself, and the fact that Austria
had only itself to blame; for the brutal severity of
the conqueror and his overbearing arrogance were
alone responsible. Genoa retained its freedom after
this, and the war was continued with varying results
until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle put an end to the
bloodshed; but Austria had no cause to rejoice
over this peace, and Maria Theresa felt it deeply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The Queen, however, now turned her vigorous
mind and generous sympathies into other channels
than those which ran red with human blood, and
devoted herself to the welfare of her people. War,
even in its grandest aspect, is and must always be
degrading to humanity and a source of untold
misery. The old German saying that &ldquo;Peace
nourishes; strife consumes,&rdquo; is a true one. In spite
of manifold disasters, Maria Theresa had emerged
from the long struggle with success; she had defeated
the efforts of her enemies to break her power,
and had strengthened her empire. It had taken
eight years of war; but the great Empress had not
been through this hard school of experience without
profiting much by it, even if her gains were not those
of territory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The eight years of peace that now ensued gave
her time and opportunity to effect the reforms she
had in mind, a work that appealed strongly to
her and was worthy of her best endeavors. She had
a wide field before her, for the weakness of the antiquated
system of government bequeathed from the
Middle Ages was felt on all sides. A great advance
in civilization had been made during that period,
and many cumbersome formalities had to be abandoned
in order that the administration of affairs
should be in sympathy with this development.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa grasped the situation clearly; she
understood all this, as well as her own position and
power and the country&rsquo;s needs. It was a woman
in this case that proved the old saying, &ldquo;One&rsquo;s self
is the man&rdquo;; for it was she herself who was the
motive power in these salutary reforms; it was her
own hand that guided the affairs of state and directed
the reforms in the condition of her people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Experience had taught her the value of Prince
Eugene&rsquo;s advice to her father, which unfortunately
for himself the latter had so little heeded; hence her
first thought was for the reorganization of the army.
Well as she knew its deficiencies, she showed no
haste or precipitation in making the necessary
changes, but proceeded slowly though surely to the
end she had in view. The wonderful personal
influence and power of this remarkable woman were
not the only evidences of her greatness; they were
apparent also in her successful discovery of the right
men, and assignment of them to positions where they
would be most effective and accomplish the most
good. The change brought about in the army was
an illustration of this; not only was the discipline
wonderfully improved, but so much spirit and enthusiasm
were infused into it that at the beginning of
the Seven Years&rsquo; War Frederick the Great himself
was forced to declare, &ldquo;These are no longer the
old Austrians!&rdquo; But there was the same love and
devotion for the Empress which had been manifested
in the days of the first Silesian war, and the army
submitted willingly and cheerfully to all her measures
of reform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>In this work Maria Theresa had two faithful
assistants, Count Daun, whose ancestral home was
a stronghold in the volcanic mountains of Eifel and
even in its ruined state a worthy cradle of a great
race, and Prince Wenzel Lichtenstein. As Daun,
one might say, created the infantry, so old Lichtenstein
was the founder of the new artillery&mdash;two
branches of the service in which Frederick II was
an adept. The cavalry, just as it stood, had served
as a model for Frederick, but even in that branch
of the service there was room for improvement.
Maria Theresa devoted especial attention to the
breeding of good horses for the cavalry, and took
great interest in hospital work. It would take too
long to go into all the details of this important
work, but one of her remarkable achievements must
not be overlooked. This was the construction of
a line of defences, or &ldquo;military frontier,&rdquo; along the
Turkish border, which interposed an effective barrier
against those invasions and unexpected attacks
which had been so common in previous wars with
that country.</p>
<p>If Maria Theresa&rsquo;s determined efforts to
strengthen her army really meant that she had
Silesia in her mind, who can blame her, especially
when the affection with which she clung to that lost
province and her inward conviction that two natures
like hers and Frederick II&rsquo;s could never remain
long at peace with one another, as was indeed
the case, are considered?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>With this problem of perfecting the army and fitting
it for future service&mdash;possibly the re-conquest
of Silesia&mdash;was closely linked another, suggested
by that saying of Montecuculi&rsquo;s already quoted;
namely, that the requisites of war were, firstly,
money; secondly, more money; and thirdly, more
money again, and plenty of it. The second task
that confronted Maria Theresa&rsquo;s dauntless spirit was
the question of taxes, or, in a word, what we call
finances. Austria was rich in resources, but there
had been a lack of good management in their application.
Judicious economy was much needed in
this branch of the administration, and, remembering
the extravagance and wastefulness that had prevailed
in her father&rsquo;s time, the Empress began the
reduction of expenses. This action and her realization
that the proper remedy was to be obtained
not by the imposition of crushing taxes on her subjects,
but by developing the rich resources of the
country, merely furnish further proofs of her political
wisdom and statesmanship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>During the last war, the lack of funds in the
treasury had made it necessary to impose heavy
taxes to meet the deficiency, but the system was
wrong, and failed to effect the desired object; it
only made the taxes extremely burdensome, and its
injustice increased the irritation and discontent of the
people. This was an evil that needed a remedy,
as her unerring glance had long since discovered,
and she lost no time in devoting all her energies to
the establishment of a system, wherein juster methods
should be employed; there were so many who for
various reasons were exempt from taxation, that it
became absolutely necessary to limit the number.
These reforms were received with great enthusiasm
all over the land, and endeared her still more to the
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Part of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s success was due to her
judgment and sagacity in choosing for her advisers
men of the highest talents and abilities, as well as
to that unerring tact which is one of nature&rsquo;s best
gifts to mankind, and which helped her here as it
had with the army. Among her statesmen, she
possessed in Kaunitz<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> not only an able and clever
diplomatist, who filled the highest posts of honor
with credit to himself and his country, but also a
faithful and devoted servant, and an invaluable aid
to her in all her far-reaching plans. The one with
which she was closely concerned at this time had
been suggested by England. It was a proposal to
retain the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire
of the German nation in her family, and make
her son, the Archduke Joseph, King of Rome;
thus giving him the right, on the death of her husband,
to succeed him as Emperor, and prevent any
more such destructive wars as those from which the
country had already suffered. England had devised
this scheme, and was willing to do its share toward
bringing it about; but there were many obstacles in
the way, not the least of them, Prussia. France
was another; but Germany itself, for that matter,
furnished difficulties enough to relegate its accomplishment
to the far-distant future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>The Empress, strongly as the plan appealed to
her, was cautious and said little, but England continued
to urge the matter with a persistence that
excited some doubt as to the sincerity of its attitude
toward Austria. At last its motives became
apparent, and Maria Theresa abandoned any further
consideration of the plan. This caused somewhat
strained relations between the two countries. During
the negotiations, moreover, England&rsquo;s behavior
was such that Kaunitz, in defence of the dignity of
his sovereign, was forced to protest against it as inadmissible
in diplomatic intercourse. His remonstrances
were unheeded, however; and when it came
to the question of affairs in the Netherlands, England&rsquo;s
communications and Austria&rsquo;s replies became
even more pointed. A complete rupture was inevitable,
but Kaunitz would not permit matters to
proceed as far as that until he had seen his way
clear to a union with France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>His one idea, since he had been in power, was
the recovery of Silesia, and as a means to that end
he endeavored to come to an agreement with France
and turn it to his advantage. He was shrewd
enough to keep this plan a secret, as well as that
other which went hand in hand with it, the humiliation
of Prussia. That Maria Theresa, who had
never ceased to grieve over the loss of Silesia, fully
sympathized with these schemes cannot be doubted.
The only hope of their realization, however, lay in
separating Prussia from all her allies; and an alliance
with France would be a long step in this direction.
England and France at that time were on the verge
of hostilities over the boundaries of Canada, and
England had been endeavoring to involve France
in a war with some of the European powers, so as
to have a free hand in America. This, however,
could not be accomplished without assistance; and,
beside, there was Hanover to protect. The number
of troops there had been increased, to be sure,
but they were not sufficient to insure its safety.
At this point England demanded to know how
large a force Austria could raise in case France
and Prussia should invade the Netherlands and
Hanover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Maria Theresa&rsquo;s eyes were opened now, and she
replied that she could not spare any troops from
Bohemia without exposing it to danger from
Prussia. She would furnish the twenty-five thousand
men agreed upon, in the Netherlands, leaving
England to take Reuss in payment and seek assistance
from the sovereign princes of Germany.
These terms of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s were definite and
final, but England further demanded that Austria
should not only send thirty thousand men immediately
to the Netherlands, but also an extra force
to defend Hanover. This Maria Theresa refused
to do, whereupon England threatened to break its
alliance with Austria unless it complied with these
demands. Maria Theresa then declared plainly
what she should demand of England in return for
the protection of her territory against Prussia and
Italy. Before her answer had been sent, still more
peremptory demands arrived from England; but
Kaunitz made no reply to them. Matters had
gone too far to avoid a breach any longer. England
broke off negotiations with Austria and went
over at once to the King of Prussia.</p>
<p>Frederick II had learned through a traitor at
Dresden that a secret alliance existed against him
between Austria and Saxony, to which Russia was
a party. He therefore gladly accepted the overtures
of England, since his union with France had
come to an end, with little prospect of its renewal.
The treaty between Maria Theresa and France was
signed on the first of May, 1756.</p>
<p>Thus there had been a remarkable change in the
relations of the European powers when the storm-clouds
gathered once more and broke in the Seven
Years&rsquo; War.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Battles of the Seven Years&rsquo; War</span></h2>
<p>True to his practice of boldly meeting an
impending danger, Frederick preferred
to open hostilities himself, rather than
leave it to his enemies. Why should he
hesitate to kindle the flames of war in the land of so
bitter an enemy as the Elector of Saxony (also
King of Poland) had shown himself to be? Without
any formal declaration having been made, therefore,
he proceeded to invade Saxony with an army of
sixty thousand men in three divisions. His advance,
as usual, was rapid; all places of importance were
seized, and on September 10, 1756, he entered
Dresden. The Elector fled to the fortress of
K&ouml;nigstein, which was considered impregnable, and
at the foot of which the Saxon army of seventeen
thousand men, all told, was in position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>The Queen alone remained in Dresden. She had
the key to the secret archives, and when Frederick
ordered them to be seized she placed herself
before the door of the room in which they were
kept, declaring they should never be taken except
by force. She was pushed aside, however, the
chests were broken open, and Frederick found the
documents, copies of which had been sent him by
the traitor already mentioned, and which furnished
proof of the secret alliance against him. With the
exception of this violence, which, in truth, the
august lady had brought upon herself, she was
treated with the greatest respect. The poor
country fared worse. Although pillage was
strictly forbidden, Saxony had to bear all the oppression
of a conquered country and meet levies of
all kinds. Frederick emptied the arsenals, confiscated
all the state revenues, and treated Saxony as
if it were part of his own dominions; but he spared
the people wherever it was possible. Ignoring the
protests of the Emperor and also of France, he
pursued his own course, and worked for his own
ends firmly and resolutely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The position which the Saxon troops held at the
foot of K&ouml;nigstein was unassailable. The only way
to vanquish them was by starvation, so the King
left them well surrounded and marched with his
army into Bohemia to prevent any assistance reaching
the Saxons from that quarter. There were two
Austrian armies in Bohemia&mdash;one under the command
of Marshal Browne, at Kollin; the other
under General Piccolomini at Olm&uuml;tz, and later at
K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz. Browne was Saxony&rsquo;s nearest hope of
rescue; but Frederick&rsquo;s sudden and unexpected
appearance in Bohemia took him by surprise and
found him unprepared for action. Several weeks
elapsed, in fact, before he was ready to move, and
Frederick made good use of the time. Moreover,
the Minister of War, regarded as the most conservative
of the Austrian field-marshals, wished to
spare the army as much as possible, and to threaten
Frederick for the advantage of Saxony without exposing
it to long marches and changes of position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Browne sent a force of eight thousand to Losowitz
under Count Wied, while he himself left
Kollin and took up a position near Budin. Wied&rsquo;s
vanguard met the Prussians at Peterswalde, September
tenth, and Browne was forced into an engagement.
The battle was fought near Losowitz,
October, 1756, but was not decisive, both generals
claiming the victory. Meanwhile, the famished
Saxons at K&ouml;nigstein were in terrible straits. They
had made an ineffectual effort to escape, and a
second attempt was scarcely more successful, for
their new position was no better than the one they
had abandoned. The Prussians again surrounded
them, and Browne, who had hurried forward hoping
to rescue the beleaguered army, was compelled
to retreat, leaving the unfortunate Saxons with no
choice but to lay down their arms and surrender
themselves with all their artillery to Frederick.</p>
<p>This blow crushed Saxony&rsquo;s hopes of further
resistance, but the King of Prussia, more magnanimous
than might have been expected considering
his many reasons for irritation against that country,
granted neutrality to K&ouml;nigstein and its occupants.
The Elector wisely preferred, however, to retire to
Warsaw, and Frederick, for reasons of his own,
took good care that he should meet with no interference
from Prussian troops on the way thither.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>These events closed the campaign. Browne remained
in Bohemia and the King went into Winter
quarters in Saxony, leaving part of his troops in
Silesia. Maria Theresa took the loss of Saxony
very much to heart, for she was thereby deprived of
a faithful ally. Her army had suffered little and
accomplished less, but at least it had escaped great
dangers and was safe, and this was some cause for
congratulation in Vienna; for, considering the unprepared
condition in which the opening of the
campaign had found Browne, the outcome might
easily have been different and his troops have shared
the fate of Saxony&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>At all events, Maria Theresa had received a fresh
warning to be on her guard against such an adversary,
who appeared with the swiftness of an arrow
where he was least expected, and was rarely to be
found when he was looked for. With her usual
energy she urged on the preparation of the army,
and bestowed upon the task all the care and devotion
of a mother for her children. But, busied as
she was with affairs at home, she was none the less
mindful of the value of neighborly help in time of
need,&mdash;an emergency always to be considered where
Frederick the Great was concerned. As a fact,
he himself had unconsciously done more for her
than her best friend could have accomplished; for
the summary methods he had resorted to in Saxony,
in defiance of the customary rights of nations, was
unprecedented and greatly incensed other rulers,
especially the Elector, shut up in his fortress of
K&ouml;nigstein like a bird in a cage, with no hope of
escape save by the favor of Frederick and his assurance
of safety from attack by Prussian troops,
who, to put it mildly, would scarcely have treated
him with courtly politeness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Many of these sovereigns were, no doubt, thinking
&ldquo;What has befallen Saxony might also happen in
our own lands any day&rdquo;; and if it came to the actual
question whether such a fate were merited or no,
their consciences might not have altogether acquitted
them. Be this as it may, there was a general feeling
of resentment among them, and the tendency of
popular report to magnify matters did its part
toward helping Maria Theresa by intensifying the
feeling against Frederick. Even the Holy Roman
Empire of the German nation condemned his conduct
and joined the ranks of his enemies. Frederick,
however, understood the nondescript character of
the Imperial army too well to be disturbed by this,
and his able and active adversary was also sufficiently
aware of it to urge on her own preparations
the more actively. If the Imperial army had been
her only dependence, there would have been little
hope for her; but the French alliance had proved
most satisfactory, and promised to be of the greatest
service to her in the event of the dissolution of the
German union. Indeed, its assurance of help was
now all the more certain because Frederick&rsquo;s actions
were calculated to increase the hatred of France
for him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Sweden also allied itself to France, and Russia
had promised to support Austria with an army of
one hundred thousand men. With three additional
armies, even though Sweden&rsquo;s strength did not
count for much, and a total force of four hundred
thousand, Maria Theresa&rsquo;s prospects looked very
bright, and it was not to be wondered at that
her eyes were fixed confidently and expectantly on
her beloved Silesia. Prince Charles of Lorraine
was put in command of the Austrian army, and
under him was Marshal Browne, the former
commander-in-chief in Bohemia. This completely
altered the plan of campaign that Browne had laid
out, and the rapid movements of the active enemy
had to be met with the slow-moving and cumbersome
army of the allies. After careful and judicious
consideration, it was agreed that the best way
of utilizing the co&ouml;peration of the allied armies was
to close in on Frederick from every side, and thus
destroy his forces and completely crush him. Was
the King aware of this plan? It seems probable
from the plans which he adopted. Prince Charles
and Browne occupied strong positions and calmly
waited for the Prussian attack, while Daun was stationed
some distance to the rear&mdash;a fact that caused
Frederick some uneasiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The first battle of the campaign took place in
the neighborhood of Prague on May 6, 1757.
The Austrians seemed to have the advantage at
first, for their artillery caused deadly havoc among
the Prussians. The gallant Schwerin, seeing the
danger, seized the colors of his regiment and rode
at full speed against the enemy, urging his men on
with shouts of encouragement. A shot found its
way to his heart almost instantly, but his words
still rang in every ear, his brave example was before
every eye, and his death filled every heart with
a thirst for revenge. The battle was fierce and
bloody, and resulted in a victory for the Prussians;
but it was not a decisive one, and Schwerin&rsquo;s fall was
a serious blow to them. Frederick said when informed
of his death, &ldquo;He was worth ten thousand
men to me!&rdquo; The King was greatly depressed by
this loss, and also by the fact that the greater part
of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s army was safe within the walls
of Prague, which looked like a speedy close to the
campaign. Moreover, Daun&rsquo;s division was still
fresh, and free now to join the rest of the army,
another advantage in their favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>There was nothing left for Frederick but to lay
siege to Prague; but as it promised to be a long and
tedious affair for him, he ruthlessly bombarded the
city and invoked the aid of two terrible allies&mdash;fire
and famine. Every day increased the horrors
of the situation in Prague. Prince Charles made
every effort to encourage and cheer the soldiers and
the citizens and persuade them to hold out by
promises of speedy relief, but their own sufferings
were more powerful arguments than any of his
representations. The citizens lost heart, and the
troops were continually committing acts of violence
and becoming mutinous, so that Prince Charles was
finally compelled to have a gallows erected in the
public square to warn the marauders. Matters
were desperate, when Daun approached with orders
from Maria Theresa to relieve the distressed city at
any cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The case was urgent, for the army and city
might soon fall into Frederick&rsquo;s hands, a result he
was confidently reckoning upon. Daun must be
driven from the neighborhood in order to accomplish
it, and how to do that without weakening his
besieging army was the problem that confronted
him. With his usual skill, however, he solved it
by hastening forward with a small detachment to
join the Prince of Bevern&rsquo;s division, and with him
advancing to meet Daun. The battle of Kollin
was the result of their meeting. It was a desperate
struggle, and a disastrous defeat for the hitherto victorious
King of Prussia. Daun was the victor and
Prague was saved.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa received the news with a jubilant
heart, and hastened at once with the Emperor to
inform the Countess Daun of her husband&rsquo;s victory
in person. Nor was this enough. To celebrate
the day she established the &ldquo;Order of Maria
Theresa,&rdquo; which was to be won only by deeds of
bravery in battle, and which by the infrequency of
its bestowal was held as the highest possible honor
in the Austrian army. The first cross of the order
glistened upon the breast of Daun. As a still
further expression of her joy and exultation, the
Empress had a jubilee medal coined in commemoration
of her victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The results of the battle of Kollin were far reaching.
The popular belief in Frederick&rsquo;s invincibility
received a severe blow, and the courage of his
soldiers sank in proportion as that of the Austrians
rose. Maria Theresa&rsquo;s forces were continually receiving
additions, while the Prussian army began to
dwindle. Matters looked somewhat brighter along
the Rhine, but the Imperial army with a French
auxiliary force was advancing to the rescue of Saxony,
and Frederick was forced to march hurriedly
into Thuringia to meet them, leaving his army in
Saxony and Lusatia under competent generals.</p>
<p>Soubise, so famous for his agility in retreat, fell
back at Frederick&rsquo;s approach, and Erfurt opened
its gates to him. A few days later Seydlitz surprised
the French at Gotha, and drove them away
in what might be called headlong flight; for in the
ducal palace Seydlitz found the dishes still smoking
on the table as they had been left, and he and his
officers sat down with a good appetite to enjoy the
meal the hungry Frenchmen had been so easily
frightened away from. This little exploit of the
cavalry afforded unbounded delight to the King
and his soldiers, and served as a prelude to what
was to follow at Rossbach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Nothing could equal the scorn with which the
French in their overwhelming conceit regarded
Prussia&rsquo;s little army; indeed, some of the officers
went so far as to question whether it were not derogatory
to their honor to engage in serious conflict
with such a paltry force. But when the battle
really began they took to their heels in a manner
that scarcely has its equal in history. Of the noble
Imperial army it can only be said that the greater
part of it left the field without firing a shot. It
was a rabbit-hunt, not a battle of men, in which the
Prussians played the parts of hunters and drivers
at the same time, with Seydlitz for a leader. That
doughty baron&rsquo;s only regret was that he had not
been able to catch the gallant Soubise himself; but
the swiftest horse could scarcely have done that!</p>
<p>To prove that even flight may lead to glory
Prince Soubise, whom even the French themselves
had nicknamed &ldquo;Prince Sottise,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> received a
Field-Marshal&rsquo;s staff after this. The riddle is easily
solved, however,&mdash;Pompadour!<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> The French continued
their flight as far as the Rhine, until they
were sure Frederick had been left far behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The Austrians had been victorious since the
battle of Kollin. Bevern&rsquo;s and Winterfeld&rsquo;s forces
had been defeated. Silesia was almost within their
grasp, a result they hoped to see accomplished
before the end of the campaign. But Frederick
had other plans. The battle of Rossbach had restored
Saxony to him, but matters had come to the
point when he must regain his hold on Silesia or
lose all the advantage he had won.</p>
<p>In twelve days he crossed the whole breadth of
his dominions, and effected a union with Bevern&rsquo;s
force in Silesia. This gave him about thirty-three
thousand men, and with these troops, many of them
exhausted by their long march, he faced an Austrian
army of double their strength near the village of
Leuthen. Here the Austrians met a crushing defeat;
they lost twenty-six thousand five hundred men,
killed or taken prisoners, one hundred and sixteen
cannon, fifty-one standards, and four thousand commissary,
baggage, and ammunition wagons, beside
forfeiting the results of all their former victories.
Whole regiments were annihilated or taken prisoners.
The contemptuous designation of the Prussian
army as the &ldquo;Potsdam Night-watch Parade&rdquo;
was terribly avenged, and the precept was brought
home to the Austrians, as it had been to the French
at Rossbach, that &ldquo;pride goeth before a fall&rdquo;!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>And Maria Theresa?</p>
<p>It was a bitter disappointment she was called
upon to bear. She had looked upon Silesia as her
own once more; she had seen her army triumph
over the enemy; her heart had been full of joy and
gratitude,&mdash;and now!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of these misfortunes, her
brave spirit did not quail; her faith in the justice of
her cause was unshaken. She redoubled her exertions
to strengthen the army and make up the
terrible losses it had suffered. But were there not
quiet hours when with clasped hands she raised
her tearful eyes to Heaven in prayer, as a relief
to her oppressed heart? Being but a woman, and
a devout and pious woman, it must have been so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The third year of the war began in the early
Spring: what terrible sacrifices it was to cost!
What bloodshed and suffering, what distress and
misery to thousands! Yet there was no thought
of peace. Still must the sword reap its deadly harvest,
like the scythe in the ripe grain-field, and
Maria Theresa was powerless to prevent it. Her
funds were low, their replenishment very difficult;
and what vast sums were required to fill the gaps
that Leuthen alone had caused! Bohemia was exhausted,
little dependence could be placed upon the
other states for help, and the treasury was slow in
filling. She saw nothing but difficulties ahead, and,
worst of all, the people were disheartened. The
feeling against Prince Charles of Lorraine became
so strong that he was forced to resign; but for once
the ministry of war, which usually bore the blame
of all mistakes and disasters, escaped the unsparing
censure that was universally expressed against the
commander-in-chief. Count Daun was appointed
in his place, and hastened to Vienna to consult
upon plans for the new campaign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>A few preliminary skirmishes resulted in favor of
the Austrians, but the first important event was the
loss of Schweidnitz, their last hold in Silesia. The
garrison, reduced by want and distress, were taken
prisoners by Frederick, who then advanced against
Olm&uuml;tz. From thence to Vienna was but a step,
and one that was seriously considered by many of
the Prussians. But Maria Theresa had again put
the right man in the right place&mdash;two men, indeed,
who proved themselves worthy of her confidence,
Daun and Laudon. Daun&rsquo;s great skill lay in his
choice of positions, and he possessed a caution and
deliberation that often put Frederick&rsquo;s patience to
the test and defeated his plans. He made no move
until he was satisfied as to the fitness of his army,
which consisted largely of new troops; but when his
preparations were complete he marched to the assistance
of Olm&uuml;tz, which Frederick had besieged.
He cut off the supplies of the Prussians by attacking
and destroying a heavy train of provisions and
ammunition which Frederick was anxiously expecting
and depending upon. This loss, together with
a sudden attack by Daun, forced the Prussians to
raise the siege and retreat. Olm&uuml;tz was saved.</p>
<p>Maria Theresa was greatly relieved, for she
realized the importance of Olm&uuml;tz, and was correspondingly
grateful to her commander-in-chief,
whose services she had already had good cause to
value. She built fresh hopes, too, on the invasion
of Brandenburg by the Russians, which obliged
Frederick to divide his forces to meet this new
danger. Leaving part of his army to oppose Daun,
he marched rapidly against the Russians, who were
ravaging Prussia. He defeated them with great
slaughter at Zorndorf, wreaked a terrible vengeance
upon them, and then returned to Saxony, where
he was much needed, for his brother Henry was
there and was hard pressed by Daun and the Imperial
army. Daun employed his usual tactics in
making his own position secure, while his light
cavalry continually harassed the King&rsquo;s troops, and
in avoiding the decisive action into which Frederick
was anxious to force him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Frederick pitched his camp at Hochkirchen, on
a plain directly opposite Daun, a position protested
against by all his generals and of which Keith
said, &ldquo;If the Austrians leave us here in peace, they
all ought to be hanged!&rdquo; The King paid no attention,
however, to this good advice. Daun&rsquo;s eagle
glance was not one to overlook an opportunity that
lay within his grasp, but his deliberation seemed to
imply that he did not intend to accept the bold challenge,
and Frederick had already decided to break
up his camp, when Daun suddenly fell upon it in
the early morning (October 14, 1758) while the
Prussians were still asleep. A desperate struggle
followed, at first in total darkness. Then the daylight
struggling through a heavy mist, with flames
from the burning village, lit up the scene of
slaughter where the Austrians had the foe at their
mercy. Had not Frederick&rsquo;s army maintained its
discipline so well, but a small part of it would have
escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>It was a brilliant victory for Daun, but he committed
a grave error in not following it up, as his
adversary would not have failed to do. Too late
he realized the folly of allowing his irrepressible foe
to escape, only to rally his forces and drive the
Austrians from Silesia. Daun hoped to retrieve
this blunder by achievements in Saxony. He had
the advantage there and advanced to attack Dresden,
but the Prussian General Schmettau set fire to the
suburbs and showed signs of such vigorous resistance
that, rather than see the city destroyed,
Daun abandoned the attack and withdrew into
Bohemia.</p>
<p>The results achieved by the allied armies in other
quarters were not remarkable. Daun by his victory
at Hochkirchen bore off the honors of this campaign,
nor did he lack laurels in recognition of his services.
He had a mistress who rewarded right royally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Maria Theresa needed the Winter&rsquo;s rest to
strengthen her position both at home and abroad.
Some new alliances and a renewal of the old ones
seemed to promise well for the future. Russia made
fresh preparations on land and sea; an agreement
was made with Sweden and Denmark by which they
were to close the passage of the strait against the
English, and the Imperial army bestirred itself to
repair damages.</p>
<p>Nor did Frederick neglect this opportunity to
replenish his treasury, which was much in need of it,
and to increase and improve his army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Close of the Long Struggle</span></h2>
<p>The campaign of 1759 began with inroads
by the Prussians, who committed terrible
ravages. Prince Henry of Prussia was
ordered to destroy the warehouses and
magazines in Bohemia as well as in Franconia, both
of which were suffering from depredations he had
made with the object of replenishing Prussia&rsquo;s war
coffers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Daun did not take the field until later. He
cautiously waited for the appearance of the allies, and
besides, it was important to effect the union of Laudon
with the Russians. Although Frederick exerted
himself to prevent this, Daun carried out his plans
successfully, and confronted the King with an army
of sixty thousand men. As the latter&rsquo;s total force
amounted to only forty thousand, he retired, and
the allies took up a strong position near Kunersdorf.
There they were boldly attacked by the Prussians,
and a battle ensued which at first seemed to promise
Frederick a brilliant victory; but Laudon changed
the fortunes of the day and drove the Prussians
from the field. When Frederick wrote to his minister,
Von Finkenstein, that it was a misfortune
he still lived, he expressed his desperate situation
after the battle of Kunersdorf, for had the Russians
followed up their advantage he must inevitably
have been overwhelmed. A disagreement between
Laudon and the Russian General Soltikoff was the
cause of this failure, or, as was afterwards maintained
and perhaps with some reason, the Russians&rsquo;
crafty policy did not include Frederick&rsquo;s complete
destruction. Although Soltikoff, with an eye to
possible changes in the Russian government and
its attitude toward the King of Prussia, may have
determined not to follow up the victory, still it is
difficult to explain why Daun should have remained
inactive when the enemy&rsquo;s complete defeat would
have inevitably produced such important results for
Austria. At last he moved to another position at
Triebel, which commanded the Prussian situation;
but Prince Henry contrived to annoy and harass his
troops constantly without risking a decisive engagement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>One misfortune after another befell Frederick.
General Finck&rsquo;s corps of twelve thousand men were
defeated and taken prisoners by Daun, a heavy
blow to the King&rsquo;s pride as well as to his army;
and a few days later fifteen thousand of Diereck&rsquo;s
force shared the same fate. Such a succession of
disasters seriously crippled Frederick&rsquo;s resources,
and even the re&euml;nforcements brought him by the
Hereditary Prince of Brunswick could do nothing
to help matters.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, it
was not until the beginning of January, 1760, that
the armies went into Winter quarters. Frederick
remained in Freiberg, and his troops camped in the
villages about Dresden, some of them even in tents.
It was bitterly cold and they could keep warm only
by huddling together. Sickness broke out among
them, and the mortality was great; but Daun did
not fare much better. Both armies suffered terribly,
and their losses were heavy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>The year had been a disastrous one for Frederick,
and fortune had smiled on the Empress; but
her goal, Silesia, was still far distant, although
Frederick&rsquo;s lack of resources for the continuance of
the war seemed to bring it a little nearer. Her affairs,
indeed, were in better condition than the King&rsquo;s.
He was in great need of money to recruit his army,
and obliged to resort to any expedient to obtain it.
He could not afford to be particular about his
methods, as poor Saxony discovered to its cost. The
willingness of its subjects to make sacrifices for her
made it easier for Maria Theresa to obtain the means
that she also needed for the prosecution of the war.
Frederick tried in various ways to bring about a
peace, but the Empress would not yield now that
her hopes seemed about to be realized. She resolutely
determined to continue the struggle for the
sake of Silesia, that precious jewel she hoped soon
to place once more in her imperial crown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>The next campaign opened in Silesia, and propitiously
for Maria Theresa; for, at Landshut, Laudon
destroyed a whole Prussian army corps under
General Fouquet, with the exception of a small
detachment of cavalry which managed to cut its way
through and escape. Fouquet was taken prisoner,
and all his supplies and ammunition fell into the
hands of the Austrians. Important as this achievement
was in itself, its principal value to Maria
Theresa lay in the effect produced by so signal a
victory at the very beginning of the campaign.
Her troops had fought with desperate fury and
showed no quarter, for they had been met with
stubborn resistance and heroic valor on the part of
the Prussians. There was great rejoicing when the
news of the victory reached Vienna, and no one was
happier than the Empress over the moral effect it
produced.</p>
<p>Frederick, who was confronting Daun in Saxony,
had determined to go to the assistance of Fouquet
in Silesia, but Daun followed, or rather kept close
beside him, while Lacy was in the rear, annoying
and impeding him at every turn and doing much
damage to his supply trains. Therefore he halted
at G&ouml;rlitz, and, changing his plan entirely, decided
to attempt the reconquest of Dresden. He forced
Lacy out of his way, evaded the Imperial army, and
summoned Dresden to surrender. Failing in an
attempt to surprise the city, he began to bombard
it, although he lacked heavy artillery. When Daun
discovered the King&rsquo;s move, he lost no time in
turning back after him, and, reaching Dresden, dispersed
the Prince of Holstein&rsquo;s force, and sent a
considerable body of troops to the assistance of the
garrison, in spite of all Frederick&rsquo;s efforts to prevent
it. Thinking that Daun would not allow the city
to be ruined, he continued the bombardment, and
wrought havoc within the walls. Great as its distress
was, however, Dresden would not yield, and
Frederick&rsquo;s troubles increased daily. Glatz was captured,
his losses at Dresden were very heavy, and
a large part of his necessary supplies fell into the
hands of the Austrians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Thus blow followed blow, and the loss of Glatz
depressed Frederick in proportion as it rejoiced
Maria Theresa, who thereby gained once more a
foothold in Silesia. Nor was Laudon content with
his easy conquest of Glatz. Encouraged by it, and
knowing the insufficiency of the garrison at Breslau,
he proceeded directly to that place, expecting as
speedy a victory there as at Glatz; a natural error,
perhaps, but a serious one, as he soon discovered.
The commander at Breslau was Tauentzien, a man
not easy to subdue. Although Laudon brought all
his force to bear against the city, he made no
progress toward its capture; and when Prince
Henry came to its relief, he was forced to raise the
siege.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Frederick meantime had abandoned his fruitless
bombardment of Dresden and hastened to Silesia,
where his presence was needed; but Daun must
have been accurately informed as to his movements,
for he followed closely and passed him, Lacy falling
to the rear of the Prussians. Thus there was the
strange spectacle of what seemed like one huge
army marching toward Silesia in three divisions,
while Laudon approached with his troops from
Breslau to meet them, and the Russians also advanced
to join the allies. The Austrian officer
seemed quite justified in his remark when he said,
&ldquo;The bag is open and ready to catch the Prussians;
we have only to pull the string!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this was repeated to Frederick his eyes
flashed, and he said with a bitter laugh, &ldquo;The
man has spoken truly; but I will make a hole in
the bag that they will not find it easy to mend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vienna waited anxiously for the next news.
Such a thing as Frederick&rsquo;s escape seemed scarcely
possible. But almost every night he changed his
position, which kept Daun in uncertainty as to his
whereabouts, and it was this ceaseless activity and
the wonderful mobility of his troops which proved
&ldquo;the hole in the bag&rdquo; that was to show him the
way out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>From the positions occupied by the encircling
armies of the enemy, he perceived it was Daun&rsquo;s
plan to annihilate him by a combined attack. The
decisive moment arrived on the fourteenth of August,
1760. Daun was absolutely certain of success;
and indeed who would not have been, with the
Prussians completely surrounded as they were?
During the night, however, Frederick abandoned
his position and moved to Parchwitz. Surprised
and chagrined, Daun found that his plans were
frustrated, and that, while the Prussians had not
yet escaped from &ldquo;the bag,&rdquo; he had not altogether
succeeded in &ldquo;pulling the string.&rdquo; Nor was Laudon
any the less astonished, when he approached
Liegnitz with thirty thousand men, to find the
Prussians drawn up in order of battle. He hastened
to form his own lines, but had only partially
succeeded when the enemy attacked him. Taken
completely by surprise, Laudon had the added disadvantage
of a most unfavorable position, which
greatly impeded the movements of his troops.
Though they fought bravely, returning again and
again to the charge, he was finally forced to retreat
with heavy loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Everything seemed to have conspired against the
Austrian generals. Daun might have sent assistance
to Laudon had he known of the battle; but a
strong wind prevented any sound of the heavy firing
from reaching him, so he suspected nothing. If
Laudon had sent him word, the result might have
been different&mdash;indeed must have been; but even
when he received news of it Daun made no move,
thinking the locality where the attack would have
to be made was too unfavorable to offer any hope
of success.</p>
<p>Laudon was depressed by this defeat; but he
was not held responsible for it even by the Empress,
who, while she regretted a misfortune that
was also her own, sent him assurances of her sympathy
and continued favor. To be able thus to
&ldquo;pour wine and oil on his wounds&rdquo; and keep up
her own courage as well, instead of giving way to
depression, was still another proof of the strength
and wisdom that never failed her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Frederick was well aware that his victory had
brought him only temporary relief. He had made
the &ldquo;hole in the bag,&rdquo; to be sure, but to get out of
it was another matter. Daun understood this also,
but none the less his failure to assist Laudon was a
grave error. His plans were well laid, for the position
of the Austrian and Russian forces not only
made it very difficult for the Prussians to obtain
their supplies, but must in time cut them off altogether.
The resources of Breslau had been so exhausted
by the siege that Frederick&rsquo;s only way out
of his predicament was the doubtful possibility of a
victory over Daun&rsquo;s army. The withdrawal of the
Russians, however, opened the way for him to Bohemia,
but in Saxony his outlook was unfavorable.
The &ldquo;hole in the bag&rdquo; had helped him only for
the time being, and Daun meanwhile was planning
to strike a blow at his heart by seizing Berlin.
Should the Russians be able to accomplish this, he
was to fall back, while an Austrian auxiliary force
under Lacy advanced to their support.</p>
<p>This plan was carried out, and on the third of
October the Russian vanguard suddenly appeared
before Berlin. The danger was imminent, and,
while the city hastily prepared for defence, Prince
Eugene of W&uuml;rtemberg, who had been opposing
the Swedes, hurried a part of his army to the capital
by forced marches. Help was also summoned
from Saxony, but the odds (sixteen thousand against
thirty-five thousand) were too great, and Berlin was
forced to capitulate. It was well for the city that
General Tottleben showed both clemency and forbearance,
and spared the treasures of art and learning
accumulated there; but Lacy&rsquo;s Austrian and
Saxon troops were not so considerate, and Frederick&rsquo;s
palaces were overrun and despoiled by them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>It was only a few days, however, before the news
that Frederick himself was approaching to the
rescue of his capital drove the enemy from the
walls of Berlin. Matters had not been progressing
favorably for the King. His prospects were still
dark, and if they were to assume a brighter aspect
he would be obliged to attack Daun, whose position
at Torgau was so strong as to make it a very
difficult undertaking. The Austrian troops were
fresh, moreover, and well equipped; but, notwithstanding
all this and the advantage of numbers,&mdash;Daun
had sixty thousand men, while he had but
forty thousand himself,&mdash;Frederick decided to
make the attempt, desperate as it seemed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The struggle was long and deadly; the constant
discharge of artillery shook the earth and whole
ranks were mown down, even the King himself
being wounded. Daun received a bullet in the
thigh, but he was so confident of victory that he
despatched a messenger to Vienna with the news&mdash;too
soon, however, for the day was not yet ended!
Just as night was closing in, Zieten, who had previously
taken no part in the action, scaled the
heights of S&uuml;plitz and captured the hill. This decided
the fate of the Austrians. Notwithstanding
all their efforts, they were compelled to give way
and retreat to Dresden,&mdash;a bitter blow to Daun,
who had already announced his victory in Vienna!
The battle was one of the bloodiest of the war;
sixteen thousand Austrians lay dead on the field or
were taken prisoners. But the Prussians had paid
dearly for their victory, having lost fourteen thousand
men. Maria Theresa, however, showed her
usual tact and magnanimity toward the defeated
general, by going out of her way to meet him on
his return from Torgau, and seeing that his wound
received proper attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Frederick had not succeeded, however, in wresting
the Plauen valley, the key to Dresden, from the
Austrians. They went into Winter quarters there,
while Laudon, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture
Kosel, retired to Glatz. The Russians withdrew
to Poland and the Swedes to Pomerania.
The French had accomplished little and had met
with many reverses, but toward the end of the
campaign they obtained a victory over the Hereditary
Prince of Brunswick. The struggle was continued
in Hesse without any decisive results, until
the coming of Winter made it necessary to suspend
hostilities. Thus ended the fifth year of the war,
with its harvest of death and destruction, leaving
all the armies completely exhausted. And still no
sign of peace!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his victories, Frederick had suffered
heavily, and the future looked dark for him;
while Maria Theresa could look forward, if not
confidently, at least with less doubt and anxiety.
She continued her preparations most indefatigably.
Laudon was placed in command in Silesia, while
Saxony was assigned to Daun as his field of action,
the object of their united endeavors being the reconquest
of Silesia. Frederick was aware of this,
and shaped his plans accordingly, although circumstances
compelled him to act strictly on the defensive.
He occupied the famous camp at Bunselwiltz,
where he was in a good position to protect Schweidnitz.
Laudon was anxious to attack him there, but
the Russian General Butterlin refused to be drawn
into a decisive engagement; at most he would only
consent to assist Laudon with an auxiliary force.
Frederick had no fear of an attack by day, but was
obliged to guard against the danger of being surprised
at night. September of 1761 came, and still
nothing had occurred. On the thirtieth of that
month, however, Laudon made a sudden attack on
Schweidnitz, from all sides at once, and the commander
there, who had neglected all precautions,
taken completely by surprise, was forced to surrender
unconditionally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Frederick&rsquo;s star seemed to be setting; for in
Pomerania too he had been unfortunate. The usual
vacillating and dilatory methods of the War Office
favored him somewhat, for Laudon had received
orders not to undertake any further operations and
to confine himself to the defensive. The fall of
Kolberg, which had made a stout resistance, and
only capitulated when all the supplies had given
out, was a fresh blow to the King. The Prussians
had met with no decisive results in their encounters
with the French, nor had they succeeded in inflicting
any damage upon them. The end of the campaign
left Frederick apparently on the verge of
ruin. Maria Theresa&rsquo;s heart was full of joy and
hope, for never had Silesia been so nearly within
her grasp as now, when her enemy had apparently
exhausted his last resources.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The beginning of the year 1762 seemed to give
her fresh grounds for hope, but these were suddenly
dissipated by the news of the death of the
Czarina Elizabeth of Russia.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
She had been Frederick&rsquo;s
bitterest enemy, and her successor, Peter III,
was his most enthusiastic admirer. The new Czar
gave immediate proof of his friendship by issuing a
manifesto in which he formally announced his intention
of making peace with Prussia. A treaty
was signed May 5, 1762, which restored to Frederick
all conquests made by the Russians, and paved
the way for an alliance between the two countries.
This completely altered the aspect of affairs, and
dashed Maria Theresa&rsquo;s hopes and plans to the
ground; for Frederick was now in a position to
concentrate all his forces against Austria. Sweden
too had withdrawn from its alliance with Austria,
and followed the example of Russia in making
terms of peace with Prussia. Everything seemed
conspiring against the Empress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Silesia still remained the centre of the struggle,
and Frederick assumed the command there in person,
the recapture of Schweidnitz being his first
object. Choosing a favorable position, he awaited
the arrival of the Russian troops promised him by
his new ally, Peter III, before attempting any important
move against his old adversary, Daun. Just
as all his preparations were complete, however, and
he was about to begin the attack, news arrived
which threatened to upset all his plans. The Czar,
Peter III, had been dethroned. Catherine II immediately
succeeded him, and her first act was the
recall of the troops which had been sent to assist
the Prussians. This was a misfortune which
Frederick had not anticipated, but he tried to avert
its immediate disastrous results by persuading the
Russian general to defer his departure for three days.
This made prompt action necessary, but Frederick
was the man of all others to meet emergencies.
Although the Russians took no part in the action,
Daun was quite in the dark as to their attitude, and
this uncertainty obliged him to weaken his force
by detaching a body of troops to watch them.
Frederick&rsquo;s attack was successful. Daun&rsquo;s army
was defeated and driven from the heights of Burkersdorf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s greatest anxiety now concerned
Catherine&rsquo;s attitude toward European affairs; consequently
her declaration of neutrality was a great
relief to his mind, for he feared that Russia&rsquo;s power
might be again exerted on the side of Austria.
After his victory at Burkersdorf, he lost no time in
laying siege to Schweidnitz. Daun tried to relieve
brave old Count Guasco, who was in command there,
but met with such a serious defeat at Reichenbach
that he was obliged to leave the stronghold to the
fate which finally overtook it.</p>
<p>The King next turned his attention to Saxony,
where his brother Henry was bravely resisting the
Austrians and the Imperial army. The Austrians
had not been meeting with great success, but the
arrival of Count Haddick as commander-in-chief
seemed to turn the fortune of war again in their
favor. Had Haddick not waited for re&euml;nforcements
from Daun, Prince Henry would probably
have been defeated; but by the time they arrived
the Prussian army had also been strengthened by
troops from Silesia, and in the battle of Freiberg,
which immediately ensued, the Austrians were defeated
with heavy loss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It was the last battle of this dreadful war, which
for so many long years had wrought untold misery
throughout the wretched countries that had been the
scene of the bloody conflict. Frederick, to be sure,
continued the struggle against the Imperial army
until the panic caused by Kleist&rsquo;s huzzars forced
the small German States to beg for peace. In Westphalia,
and Hesse, also, the Prussians at last laid
down their victorious arms. In truth, the exhaustion
of all parties made peace imperative. It was finally
declared February 15, 1763, and a treaty was signed
at Hubertsburg which restored all conquests and
left everything practically where it was at the beginning
of the Seven Years&rsquo; War, Prussia retaining
undisturbed possession of Silesia.</p>
<p>This was the heaviest sacrifice that Maria Theresa
could have been called upon to make for peace. It
cost her a great struggle with herself, and many
bitter tears, but she did it so that the blessings of
peace might be restored to her people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Last Days of Maria Theresa</span></h2>
<p>Peace! The joyful cry rang from one
end of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s dominions to the
other, and was echoed in her own heart;
for, deeply as she grieved over Silesia, now
lost to her forever, she must have had a feeling of
thankfulness when she thought of those battlefields
which had been reddened with the blood of so
many thousands of her people. Her deeply religious
nature must have prompted the thought:
&ldquo;Since all my sacrifices, all my efforts and exertions
have availed nothing toward the restoration of Silesia
to me, it must be the will of Him who rules all, and
without whose notice not a sparrow falls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The great Empress, who could control herself so
well, could not fail to recognize how incomplete her
efforts toward governing and improving the condition
of her people had been thus far, and to welcome
a peace which would enable her to continue
the work, and, in devoting all her energies to remove
the devastation caused by the war, find a balm
for the wound in her own heart which the loss of
Silesia had inflicted.</p>
<p>It would be doing Maria Theresa a great injustice,
however, to imply that she to whom the condition
of the government and its evils had been so clear,
even during her father&rsquo;s lifetime, had not profited
by the occasional intervals of peace which the
country had enjoyed, and worked zealously for their
reform until war again turned the ploughshare into
the sword. It was impossible for her to recognize
defects without endeavoring to remedy them. We
have already seen how resolutely she checked the
luxury and extravagance of the Court after her
father&rsquo;s death; how, taught by bitter experience the
need of reformation in the army, she had strengthened
and prepared it for the long and desperate
struggle that was to come; how she had increased
the country&rsquo;s revenues and readjusted the system
of taxation upon which she depended for means to
defend her right to the throne; and with what
unerring judgment she had chosen the best men to
carry out her plans, and placed them where their
abilities would be of most service to the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Her character and talents especially fitted her for
the position she occupied as sovereign of a great
Empire in need of reorganization, for to her clear
insight, her habit of going to the root of things,
and her wide sympathies, was added a calmness and
strength of purpose which enabled her to achieve
great results without rashness or precipitancy. Her
reforms indeed were brought about so gradually,
and newer and more effective methods succeeded
the old so naturally, that they aroused no opposition,
and were accomplished with none of that
confusion which more abrupt and violent changes
might have caused. She took great pleasure in
watching the fruitful results of these efforts, without
any desire for that personal glory which is often so
cheaply obtained. There was, in truth, no department
of public affairs which was not in need of
reconstruction, no part of the national life where
she did not find something to rectify; but nothing
escaped her, even to the smallest detail. Everywhere,
from the army down to her own domestic
service, the results of her conscientious care and
judicious supervision were visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>In all matters of learning and education Maria
Theresa depended on the help of Van Swieten, an
eminent and accomplished Dutch physician. She
had appointed him to a position in Court, but soon
recognized his profound knowledge in all branches
of learning, and at once assigned him to a field
where his talents could be utilized, not only in the
sanitary administration of her realm, but also in
other departments in which his services were quite
as valuable.</p>
<p>Under the personal supervision of the Empress,
Van Swieten undertook the reconstruction of the
whole system of education and the reorganization of
the Imperial library. Many schools and institutions
were established, including one for the study of
Oriental languages, rendered necessary by the increasing
importance of Austria&rsquo;s relations with the
East, one for veterinary surgery, and an academy
for young noblemen. Though deeply and sincerely
devout, Maria Theresa realized that the ecclesiastical
power and authority required restriction, and that
the condition of the monasteries was sadly in need
of reform. Much as she accomplished for higher
culture, the education of the lower classes was no
less important to her; for Austria had not kept pace
with general progress in this direction, and dense
ignorance prevailed among them. Her chief adviser
and supporter in this work was Joseph von
Sonnenfels, whose suggestion, &ldquo;It is not enough to
have public schools in the large cities; not even
the smallest village should be without one,&rdquo; was
warmly approved by Maria Theresa, the mother of
her country. The Normal School in Vienna set an
example for other cities, which was soon followed
in the so-called &ldquo;low country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>If the abolishment of the rack, with its inhuman
and unchristian tortures, had been Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
only contribution to higher civilization in her Empire,
she would have deserved the thanks, not only of her
own people but of all mankind; but while this was
her most notable act, there was no department of
life, no branch of the government, that did not bear
witness to her noble qualities of head and heart or
feel the influence of her beneficent power. She loved
and fostered music, and among the masters who
shed a lustre over that period the great names of
Gluck, Haydn, and Mozart will testify to her unfailing
interest in this art; while the branches of
painting and sculpture claimed no less a share of
her patronage and support.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It is useless to attempt here to go into all the
details of her various achievements, but one subject
must be mentioned which deeply involved the
welfare of the people and of the country,&mdash;that of
agriculture, trade, and commerce. Her efforts to
improve agricultural conditions were necessarily
rudimental, and results were left for the future to
develop; but it was Maria Theresa&rsquo;s sowing that
made the harvest of later times possible, and she
prepared the way by founding schools for the study
of agriculture, thus providing opportunities for the
farmers to secure larger knowledge of their avocation.
Another great step was the realization of the need
of a system of drainage, now so indispensable to
human welfare, but which at that time had received
little attention, especially in Austria. She instituted
a thorough study of the subject, had large areas of
land drained and made productive, thus providing
more farms for the people. She also built new villages
in the sparsely populated districts of Hungary,
Galicia, Bohemia, and Banat,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> and settled them with
industrious workmen; founded the Economical
Society of Lower Austria, and instituted annual
prize examinations. She imported merino sheep
from Spain, and had them distributed among sheep-raisers.
In Hungary and Bohemia, where there
were large flax fields, apiaries were started. Fine
breeds of horses were raised for use by the cavalry.
In these and other ways the resources of the country
were developed for its own enrichment, instead of
going out of the country for the advantage of foreign
treasuries. Trade and commerce were facilitated by
the building of new roads and canals. Rivers were
made more navigable; new markets were opened up
and seaports were improved and increased, while
home industries and manufactures were encouraged
by the erection of factories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>In short, the field over which her watchful supervision
extended was boundless, and yet every detail
received her personal attention. All reports were
made to her directly, and she discussed matters of
all kinds with those who were experts, often surprising
them by her accurate knowledge and apt suggestions.
And yet with all these cares the Empress
still found time to perform the various duties of
government with unabated zeal and energy, and
devoted herself to her family, the care of which was
a sacred mission to her, with the utmost fidelity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>As we take a glance into this august family circle
it is difficult to believe it that of an Emperor and
Empress, such an atmosphere of simplicity and
sincere affection prevailed there. Maria Theresa
presided over it with all the womanly charm and
devotion of a true German housewife and mother.
A handsomer royal couple could scarcely have been
found. Their married life had been very happy,
for they were one in heart and mind. She was
devoted to her husband and he to her, although
her father had not favored the attachment. The
Emperor Francis II was calm and deliberate;
Maria Theresa high-spirited and quick-tempered,
but firm and decided, and full of life and vivacity.
Their natures therefore complemented each other,
the Emperor&rsquo;s placidity and easy-going disposition
often acting as a beneficial restraint. When a disagreement
occurred between them,&mdash;something that
will happen in the happiest married life,&mdash;the
Empress would burst out impetuously, while her
consort only grumbled in his beard; but the chief
lady-in-waiting, Countess Fuchs, who shared the
confidence of both, usually succeeded in soon restoring
peace, for their misunderstandings never
lasted long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The Emperor rarely concerned himself with
matters that did not appeal to his own tastes and
inclinations, and took no part in affairs of state except
at the request of his wife. At such times he
gave his advice gladly and cheerfully, for no one
could resist the covert flattery of Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
entreaties. Their marriage was blessed with sixteen
children, living bonds which united and made the
happiness of their lives, and whose love and affection
were a refuge to the Empress from the cares of
state. How often must her weary brain and overburdened
soul have found rest and comfort in the
embraces of her children, especially the younger
ones, always nearest to a mother&rsquo;s heart, while she
drew fresh strength and courage from their pure and
innocent affection! The difference in the natures of
the imperial pair was of advantage also in the training
of their children, for the father&rsquo;s unfailing patience
and good nature often acted as a check on the mother&rsquo;s
hasty and imperious temper. At the same time
there was no friction, for they were of one mind as
to the importance of implanting the right principles;
the Emperor insisting on strict obedience, propriety
of behavior, and order (which was especially dear to
him), while their moral and religious training fell to
the share of the Empress, who never appeared lovelier
or more interesting than in the privacy of her
family life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The education of their numerous children was
the most sacred duty and interest of both parents,
and their teachers were selected with the greatest
care. The Empress devoted especial attention to
the education of her oldest son and successor,
Joseph, particularly in the various languages
spoken in her dominions. She knew from her
own experience how strong is the bond between a
sovereign and his people when he can speak with
them in their mother-tongue. As a mark of her
gratitude toward Hungary, she gave her dear &ldquo;Seppel&rdquo;
(her familiar name for the Archduke Joseph),
as steward of his household, the brave Hungarian
Prince Bathiany, a man well fitted for the position
and much esteemed and beloved by his own
countrymen. No detail was neglected in the care
bestowed on the management of the royal children,
and the Empress&rsquo; strict orders that they should
&ldquo;always be courteous to servants and inferiors&rdquo;
might well serve as an example to all mothers.
This simple and beautiful family life, which had
been Maria Theresa&rsquo;s chief joy and happiness, was
sadly shattered by the death of the husband to
whom she was so tenderly attached. It cast a deep
shadow over the rest of her life, and from the day
of his death she never laid aside her mourning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>How richly Maria Theresa rewarded faithful service,
aside from the honors or orders she conferred,
is shown by the friendly relations between herself
and the men she most valued and esteemed. She
called old Count Palffy her &ldquo;father&rdquo;; the brave and
loyal Khevenh&uuml;ller, her &ldquo;knight&rdquo;; gallant Traun,
her &ldquo;shield&rdquo;; and so on. Of the honored Count
Chotek she once wrote: &ldquo;I have had news from
him every day, and was anxious for two days lest
the worst might happen. When he is able to be
out of bed, I shall visit him.&rdquo; Again, when Count
Chotek had begged from the Empress the services
of the Court physician, Dr. Kessler, for his sick
child, she wrote back at once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God that he is to be in such good
hands as Kessler&rsquo;s. It can be easily arranged, and
the letter will be sent to Van Swieten as a matter
of form. I could not sleep last night for thinking
of the charming child, and Van Swieten was much
affected when he learned from me of his condition,
but cheered up at once when he found that Kessler
had charge of him. I hope he will not be marked
as his brother Humelauer was,<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> and that Kessler
will let me know every day how he is, for I am
deeply interested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="988" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Be comforted, my good woman, for I have come to see you</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Once when she was at Laxenburg<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> it chanced
that a poor woman, one hundred and eight years of
age, who was well known to her, and had not
missed for many years the usual ceremony of the
foot-washing on Maundy Thursday, was unable
that year to be present, and bitterly lamented that
she was not to see her beloved Empress. Maria
Theresa heard of this, and was so touched by it that
she went herself to the dame&rsquo;s miserable dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were grieving,&rdquo; she said, with her winning
smile, &ldquo;because you could not see me? Well, be
comforted then, my good woman, for I have come
to see you,&rdquo; and seating herself by the sick-bed she
talked for some time with the delighted old woman
in her kindly and sympathetic way, leaving when
she departed a sum of money for her care and support.
Nor did she ever afterward lose sight of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>An event which happened at the time of the birth
of one of her grandsons is deeply graven on the
hearts of the Austrians. She was at the theatre on
the evening of February 19, 1768, when a message was
brought to her announcing the birth of a son to her
daughter-in-law, the wife of her son Leopold, Grand
Duke of Tuscany. Overjoyed with the news, she
quickly rose, and leaning far over the railing of her
box she waved the paper and announced to the
audience, &ldquo;Leopold has a boy!&rdquo; It may be
imagined what applause followed these words, so
clearly illustrating the familiar relations existing
between her and her people.</p>
<p>But Maria Theresa&rsquo;s declining years unfortunately
were destined to be no less stormy than the
rest of her life had been. The death of her husband,
coming so suddenly and unexpectedly, was a
crushing blow, but in so far as she felt the need of
a man&rsquo;s help she depended on her son Joseph. She
made him co-regent with her, not because his
youthful strength and energy were necessary to her,
but because circumstances made it desirable. Many
political complications had arisen&mdash;notably the partition
of Poland, against which Maria Theresa,
with her strong sense of right and justice, protested
vigorously. The mere mention of it sufficed to
arouse her furious indignation. Although the
Poles had brought it upon themselves, and perhaps
deserved no better fate, she felt sure that only evil
could result from such a step, as a declaration she
made over her own signature when the affair was
concluded shows. It ran thus: &ldquo;I agree to it since
such a number of wise men have so decreed, but
long after I am dead time will show the bitter consequences!&rdquo;
The whole affair caused her &ldquo;great
sorrow,&rdquo; as she herself expressed it, and made her
feel &ldquo;more anxious than anything has ever done;
indeed I am ashamed to have witnessed it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The Emperor Joseph&rsquo;s political views were decidedly
opposed to those of his great mother, and
necessarily so, perhaps, owing to the changes in conditions
and circumstances. This was especially the
case in the matter of the Bavarian succession, which
cast a shadow over the Empress&rsquo; later years. On the
death of the Elector of Bavaria without issue, Joseph
laid claim to his dominions; but Maria Theresa recognized
the weakness of these claims, although at the
same time she strongly resented Frederick II&rsquo;s interference
and opposition to her son&rsquo;s plans. She
shrank from the prospect of another war, but the
situation became so involved and threatening that a
conflict seemed inevitable. Preparations for war
were actually begun, when the Peace of Teschen<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
put an end to the danger, much to Maria Theresa&rsquo;s
relief as well as satisfaction, for she had practically
been the means of bringing it about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Her great influence and popularity remained undiminished
to the last; nor did age destroy the
charm of her personality, although increasing stoutness
caused her much annoyance and trouble. Her
mind and heart retained all their youthful vigor,
however, nor did she ever lose her kindly interest
and sympathy for those about her.</p>
<p>On the eighteenth of November, 1780, a singular
accident occurred to the Empress. Her grief for her
dead husband was deep and sincere, and she faithfully
observed every anniversary of his death, often
going to his tomb in the imperial vault. As she
walked with great difficulty, however, and the climbing
of stairs was especially unpleasant to her, she
had had a sort of seat contrived in which she could
be raised or lowered easily and slowly into the vault.
Upon her visit to the tomb on this occasion she
had almost reached the floor of the vault when the
strong rope which lowered her broke. She was not
injured except from the shock, but this affected her
all the more, for she regarded the incident as an
omen that she too would soon be consigned to that
silent place of rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Indeed, on the very next day, possibly as the result
of a chill contracted in the tomb, she was seized
with convulsive attacks of coughing, which she at
first considered of little consequence; but the spasms
grew so much worse that suffocation was feared.
Bleeding brought little relief, and pleurisy soon developed,
increasing her distress so that she was
forced to sit up in an arm-chair. She bore her sufferings
patiently and uncomplainingly, however.
Only once, after a severe paroxysm of coughing and
struggle for breath, she said, &ldquo;God grant the end
may come soon, for I do not know how I can bear
it any longer,&rdquo; and to the Archduke Maximilian
she remarked, &ldquo;Thus far my courage and firmness
have not deserted me; pray God, upon Whom all
my thoughts are fixed, that I may keep them to
the last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The malady increased, and a premonition of approaching
death seized her. She called for the last
sacrament, like a good Catholic, and then summoned
to her bedside all the members of her family who
were in Vienna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear children,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have received the
holy sacrament and know there is no hope of recovery
for me. Remember what care and pains your
father, the late Emperor, and I have bestowed upon
your education; how we have always loved you
and tried to do everything for you that could add
to your happiness. All that I have in the world
belongs to you,&rdquo; turning to the Emperor Joseph,
&ldquo;so I need make no disposition of anything.
Only my children belong to me, and always will.
I commit them to your care. Be a father to them!
I shall die content if I have your promise to watch
over them truly and faithfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the other children she said, &ldquo;Henceforth
you must look upon the Emperor as your sovereign;
obey and honor him as such. Be guided by
his counsel; trust and love him with all your hearts,
that he may have cause to bestow on you his care,
his friendship, and his affection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Then she quietly and calmly bestowed a maternal
blessing upon each of her children, absent as well as
present. Deeply moved, they gave way to their
grief in sobs and tears, which affected Maria Theresa
most painfully, but she controlled herself and said
to them firmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be better for you to go into
the next room and compose yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at that solemn moment she was still busy
with affairs of government, and she signed several
state documents with her own hand. She thanked
her faithful Kaunitz for his loyal service to her,
and also charged the Hungarian chancellor, Esterhazy,
to convey her thanks to his people for all
their loyalty, devotion, and help in time of need, at
the same time bidding the Emperor Joseph ever to
bear this in mind.</p>
<p>Joseph never left her side. She suffered greatly
from distress for breath, and at eight o&rsquo;clock cried
out: &ldquo;Open the window!&rdquo; at the same time rising
from her chair. The Emperor supported her gently
in his arms, and asked, &ldquo;Where does Your Majesty
wish to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking upward, she cried, &ldquo;To thee! I come!&rdquo;
and with these last words sank back and expired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Her death occurred November 29, 1780, in the
sixty-fourth year of her age. Four days afterward
she was laid by the side of her husband in the imperial
vault of the Capuchins in Vienna. Her death
plunged the whole country into mourning. Few
have departed from life so beloved and so honored.</p>
<p>Frederick the Great wrote of her: &ldquo;The death
of the Empress has grieved me much; she honored
her throne and her sex. I have made war upon
her, but I have never been her enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The term &ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction&rdquo; was first used in the case of decrees issued
by Byzantine emperors with reference to the affairs of their provinces. It was
next applied to the limitations of the spiritual authority of the Pope in European
countries. In the sense in which it is used above it is applied to the succession of
sovereignty. The Pragmatic Sanction of Charles VI is the most famous of all.
It had three provisions, (1) that the lands belonging to the house of Austria should
remain indivisible; (2) that in the absence of male heirs they should devolve upon
Charles&rsquo; daughters, the oldest of whom was Maria Theresa; and (3) that in case
of the extinction of the line, the inheritance should pass to the daughters of Joseph
I and their descendants. Charles issued this Sanction in 1713.

Francis Stephen of Lorraine in 1736, came to the throne in 1740, her husband
being declared co-regent. She died in 1780. Of her sixteen children, ten reached
maturity. Her sons were Joseph II, who succeeded his father as Holy Roman Emperor
in 1765; Emperor Leopold II; Ferdinand, Duke of Modena, and Maximilian,
Elector of Cologne. Her most famous daughter was Marie Antoinette,
wife of Louis XVI of France, one of the many victims of the French Revolution.

war of the succession invaded Italy; joined Marlborough in Germany; and defeated
the French and Bavarians at Blenheim in 1704. In 1706 he drove the French
out of Italy, and in 1708 won the great victories at Oudenarde, Lille, and Malplaquet.
War breaking out afresh with Turkey, he won the great battle at Belgrade
against overwhelming odds, and forced the Turks to accept peace. The year of

<p class="center"><i>BIOGRAPHICAL ROMANCES
<br /><span class="small">TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN BY</span></i>
<br /><span class="large">GEORGE P. UPTON</span></p>
<p class="center small"><i>A new, interesting, and very useful series that will be found especially suitable for school libraries and for supplementary reading</i></p>
<p>The books in this series are translated from the German, because
in that country a specialty is made of really desirable
reading for the young. Eight titles are now ready and more will
follow.</p>
<p>Their simplicity and accuracy make them very useful for every
school library in the grades.</p>
<p>For parents who feel disposed to give their children books that
provide a mild element of historical information, as well as first-class
entertainment, the little books will prove a veritable find.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;life-stories&rdquo; retain the story form throughout, and embody
in each chapter a stirring event in the life of the hero or the action
of the time. The dramatis person&aelig; are actual characters, and the
facts in the main are historically correct. They are therefore both
entertaining and instructive, and present biography in its most attractive
form for the young.</p>
<p class="center smaller">A FULL LIST OF THE TITLES IS GIVEN ON THE NEXT PAGE</p>
<p>The work of translation has been done by Mr. George P.
Upton, whose &ldquo;Memories&rdquo; and Lives of Beethoven, Haydn, and
Liszt, from the German of Max Mueller and Dr. Nohl, have been
so successful.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Each is a small square 16mo in uniform binding, with four illustrations. Each 60 cents net.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;These narratives have been well calculated for youthful minds
past infancy, and Mr. Upton&rsquo;s version is easy and idiomatic.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Nation.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a delightful writer, clearness, strength, and sincerity marking
everything to which he puts his hand. He has translated these little
histories from the German in a way that the reader knows has conserved
all the strength of the original.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;They are written in simple, graphic style, handsomely illustrated,
and will be read with delight by the young people for whose benefit
they have been prepared.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The work of translation seems to have been well done, and these
little biographies are very well fitted for the use of young people....
The volumes are compact and neat, and are illustrated sufficiently but
not too elaborately.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;These books are most entertaining and vastly more wholesome than
the story books with which the appetites of young readers are for the
most part satisfied.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Indianapolis Journal.</i></p>
